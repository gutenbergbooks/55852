</div>


<p>The mother had been very ill, and the question
was, where shall we take her so that she
may get thoroughly well? It must be some place
where the family might accompany her. She
had declared that she would not go without
papa and Nellie and Walter.</p>

<p>It was nearing the close of schooltime, and
papa's yearly vacation was at hand, so there
would be no difficulty on that score. Some one
had suggested Santa Monica as affording a complete
change of scene, but the doctor tabooed
that place and she herself did not care for it.</p>

<p>"She is already too near the sea," the man
of medicine said. "She needs entire change;
she would only grow ill again and nervous amid
the clatter of hotel life and the crowds on the
beach."</p>

<p>"But we might take a cottage," suggested
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I know those seaside cottages," said
the doctor, "that is, those which are built to
rent for the season. A few boards thrown together,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
and only a pretence made of papering
the walls inside&mdash;draughts rushing through the
rooms continually and underneath the house
as well. Why, my dear sir, you can actually
see the carpet rising in waves from the floor.
They are all erected on piles, you know. No
seaside cottage for our invalid&mdash;no, indeed."</p>

<p>"What do you say to the mountains, doctor?"
asked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"The very thing," was the reply. "But there
are objections to be made in that case also.
Accommodations are not usually comfortable&mdash;the
food is always plentiful, but not always
choice."</p>

<p>"I was thinking of camping," said Mr. Page.
"I have a complete camping outfit and at my
call a man, Charlie Dorner, who is the prince
of cooks. He is, besides, a fine general utility
man&mdash;can do anything."</p>

<p>"That would be the ideal; but," sighed the
doctor, "I wish I could go along."</p>

<p>"And so you can; or join us later."</p>

<p>"Well, we'll see about that. Just now we're
talking of Mrs. Page. If you have an outfit
of your own you need not be at anybody's
mercy. But you must not choose too high a location,
nor where it is likely to be too warm,
nor an utterly inaccessible place. By that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
mean she must not be too far from the railroad&mdash;or
her doctor. What do you say to the
Springs? I have an idea that the air and the
hot water together would complete her cure."</p>

<p>"The air!" exclaimed Aunt Mary. "Why,
it is only fourteen miles from here; there can't
be any difference in the atmosphere. Besides,
those springs are in a valley; you can't have
seen them. The fogs are dreadful in the early
morning I have been told."</p>

<p>"Not at <i>my</i> Springs," said the doctor with
a smile. "I'm speaking of Warner's Ranch,
although I've stayed at the others and have
seen wondrous cures effected there, I assure
you."</p>

<p>Aunt Mary had not been long in California,
but she was fond of "reading up," and she had
been reading about Warner's Ranch.</p>

<p>"Do you mean the springs which belong, or
were supposed to belong, to the Indians, from
whose possession they are now going to be
taken?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the doctor; "and I think the
whole proceeding is an infamous outrage."</p>

<p>Nellie and Walter had been sitting quietly
listening to their elders. But at this point in
the conversation Walter, who was thirteen, exclaimed:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, papa, let us go there, won't you?</p>

<p>"Just think, Aunt Mary," he continued, "it
is a regular Indian village, and in the summer
the Indians move out of their houses and rent
them to the white people. I knew a boy who
lived in one, and he said it was fine. Wouldn't
it be grand making believe to be an Indian!"</p>

<p>"I sympathize with those poor creatures very
much," said Aunt Mary. "I think it is heartless
to evict them from their homes; but I <i>don't</i>
believe I should care to occupy one of the houses.
It might not be clean, you know."</p>

<p>"Well, that's as may be," said the doctor. "I
have known persons loud in their praises of
the place, and others whining about dirt and
discomfort. You would not be subject to anything
of that kind. You would have your large,
clean, comfortable tents."</p>

<p>"Let's tell mother. Let's ask her if she would
like to go," said Nellie, speaking for the first
time.</p>

<p>"Of course she'll like it; she's certain to like
it," cried Walter, springing to his feet. They
were not long in ascending the stairs, though
they went quietly, having become accustomed to
making as little noise as possible during their
mother's long and serious illness. Now that
she was so much better they had not renounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the habit, which had become a sort of second
nature to them.</p>

<p>"Come in," said a sweet, low voice as Nellie
tapped on the door. In a moment they were
both kneeling beside the lounge where their
mother lay.</p>

<p>"You don't feel <i>very</i> bad this afternoon,
mamma?" inquired Walter, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," she replied. "On the contrary, I
am feeling particularly well and strong to-day.
But the doctor says I must lie down the greater
part of the time. I thought I heard his voice
just now. Hasn't he gone yet?"</p>

<p>"No; that's why we came, mother," said
Nellie. "They're discussing things in the library.
They think now they'll take you to
Warner's Hot Springs, and we want you to go
there, we do, badly. Oh, it will be great fun."</p>

<p>"Papa is talking of getting out the tents and
the camping wagon and taking Charlie Dorner
along. Oh, it will be lots of fun. I hope you
like the plan."</p>

<p>"I am sure I shall like it," replied their
mother. "I am very fond of camping. Don't
you remember the summer we spent at Broad
Beach?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was lots of fun," said Walter.
"But that wasn't anything to what this will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
be. Fancy, mother, an Indian village&mdash;a real
Indian one. And you can live in their houses
if you want to&mdash;though Aunt Mary says she
doesn't believe they are very clean."</p>

<p>"We would have our tents," said Nellie. "Dr.
Madden says he thinks the water would do you
a great deal of good, mother."</p>

<p>"I feel better already," said the mother, sitting
up and smoothing back her hair. "I want
to start at once."</p>

<p>They all laughed, and presently the children
were seated beside her, each holding a hand,
wondering when everything would be in readiness
for the start.</p>

<p>"We don't have to get any new clothes, do
we?" inquired Nellie, to whom the bugbear of a
summer outfit was receding into the background.</p>

<p>"No; we shall wear our oldest things," replied
the mother. "Still, we shall not aim to
make scarecrows of ourselves, my dear, as some
people really seem to do when they go camping."</p>

<p>The children laughed again. "As though
you <i>could</i> make a scarecrow of yourself!" exclaimed
Nellie, looking fondly at her fair, delicate
mother in her dainty white wrapper, and
shoulder shawl of soft, scarlet wool.</p>

<p>"But suppose they would put the Indians out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
while we are there; then what would we do,
mother?" asked Nellie. "I couldn't bear to be
near and see it," said the tender-hearted child.
"I think it's dreadful, don't you, mother?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is," rejoined her mother. "Yet it
does not seem possible to avoid it."</p>

<p>"Tell us about it, mother, will you?" pleaded
Walter. "There has been much fuss over it in
the papers. Why do the Indians have to go
away from this place where they have lived
so long?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Page reflected for a moment before replying.
Then she said:</p>

<p>"I can't remember all the details, and you
would not be interested in them if I could; but
as nearly as I know the facts of the case I shall
try to relate them to you.</p>

<p>"Many years ago Col. Juan Jos&#233; Warner received
a grant of immense tracts of land from
the Mexican government. On these lands, or
part of them, some tribes of Indians were then
living. They and their forefathers had lived
there for many years. It was a provision of
the grants or patents given by the Mexican government
that the 'mission Indians' were never
to be disturbed. In nearly all cases their rights
were respected. Do you understand, dear
children?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>Walter nodded, but Nellie said: "Mamma,
how was it that the <i>Mexican</i> government
granted lands to people in California?"</p>

<p>"Why, don't you know that California was
once part of Mexico?" inquired Walter, with a
little air of superiority.</p>

<p>"I believe I used to, but maybe I have forgotten
it," murmured Nellie, quite discomfited,
as she always was when her brother asserted his
better knowledge of history and current events.</p>

<p>"Well, mamma, what next?" inquired the
boy. "We don't want to 'lose the thread.'
That's what our teacher says when the scholars'
attention seems to wander."</p>

<p>"After some time," resumed Mrs. Page, "this
tract of land, known by the name of Warner's
Ranch, was sold to Governor Downey, who did
not molest the Indians. There were several
tribes besides those who lived at the Hot
Springs. But later there was a lawsuit, and
many endeavors were made to eject them, on the
ground that they had only occupied the land
<i>after</i> it had been granted to Warner.</p>

<p>"This lawsuit has been going on for many
years. Recently it has been decided, very unjustly,
most people think, that the Indians
must go."</p>

<p>"But where are they to go?" asked Nellie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
her round blue eyes opening with every word.
"Where <i>can</i> they go?"</p>

<p>"The United States government will place
them on some other reservation," said Mrs.
Page. "A commission has been appointed to
select one where the land is fertile and water
plentiful. It will not be very long now, I think,
before some place will be decided upon. It is
a very good thing that every one on the commission
is a friend of the Indians, and would
allow them to remain in their present home if
they could arrange it."</p>

<p>"Is Warner's Ranch a very large tract of
land, mother?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Very large, my son."</p>

<p>"Why can't they let the Indians stay on their
little bit of land, then? They haven't a great
deal, have they?"</p>

<p>"Not much, compared with the extent of the
whole tract. However, the owners of the ranch
wish to derive profit from the springs, as the
Indians are doing, only they would erect wooden
buildings and make many improvements. They
wish to make the springs a popular resort."</p>

<p>"I'd never go there if they did, never!" said
Nellie. "How can the government be so unjust
as to put those Indians out, when they
have always lived there?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems that when the tract was originally
sold the Indians should have presented their
claim to the portion they occupied. As they
did not do that, after a certain number of
years their rights were forfeited. That is the
law."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they present their claims?"
asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Simply, my son, I suppose, because they
were ignorant of the requirements of the law.
They had lived there always; they could not
remember having heard of a time when their
forefathers had not lived there. They did not
dream they would ever be disturbed. And so
it came to pass that when they were informed
steps had been taken to eject them they paid
no attention to it."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they get a lawyer to attend to
it for them?"</p>

<p>"After some time they did. There were able
lawyers employed on both sides. The suit has
lasted for many years, has been taken from one
court to another, and now it has been finally
decided that the Indians must go. I have
heard that many of them still refuse to believe
it."</p>

<p>"I call it a beastly shame," said Walter.
"Why don't they fight?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>"What could a couple of hundred warriors
do against the United States government?" replied
Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"I thought the Comanches and Apaches, and
those Indian tribes liked to fight just for the
sake of fighting," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"That is probably true," replied Mrs. Page;
"but our California Indians are neither Comanches
nor Apaches, my dear. They have always
been peaceful, and have been called the
'mission Indians' from the time of the first establishment
of the Spanish Franciscans at San
Diego. The Warner Ranch Indians are called
<i>Cupe&#241;os</i>, from <i>Cupa</i>, the name given to the
hot springs. Comfortable and happy they were
while under the control of the mission Fathers;
but since the time that the missions were abolished
and the priests scattered things have been
very different. That was after the Mexican
War, about which you both know something, I
believe. Certainly Walter does."</p>

<p>"I'm very anxious to go, aren't you, mother?"
asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, if it has been decided that it will benefit
me," said Mrs. Page. "I should like to
start to-morrow if I could."</p>

<p>"Here they come&mdash;papa, Aunt Mary and the
doctor," said Nellie, as footsteps were heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
ascending the stairs; "I hope they haven't
found many objections."</p>

<p>Everybody was smiling as they entered, and
the doctor said: "Mrs. Page, no doubt the little
ones have prepared you for our verdict. We
have decided to send you to the hot springs.
The sooner you are ready to start the better."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="small">THE JOURNEY.&mdash;FRANCISCO.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On a bright morning in early June, Charlie
Dorner drove up to the Pages' door with a large
camping wagon, to which two strong, stout
mules were harnessed. The wagon was then
laden with things brought from the house in
barrels, boxes, baskets, and bundles. One not
familiar with the capacity of California mules
would have thought it impossible for two animals
to haul the tremendous load on the long
climb, which was to end sixty miles in the mountains,
three thousand feet above the level of the
sea.</p>

<p>Charlie Holden, in a suit of corduroy, with
high boots and leggings, and a huge sombrero of
Mexican make on his curly red head, excited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
admiration of Walter, who had never seen him
before. The mules started off without balking
after one crack of Charlie's whip. The speed
with which they started was not great, but Mr.
Page, who stood with the children watching the
departure, said they would be likely to keep the
same pace until their destination was reached on
the afternoon of the following day.</p>

<p>"I'd like awfully well to go along," said
Walter. "I wish I had thought of it before.
Would you have let me go, papa?"</p>

<p>"No; I think it is better that we should all
keep together," said Mr. Page. "I am sure
mother would not have considered it for a
moment."</p>

<p>"I think it is nearly time to start, don't you,
father?" inquired Nellie, consulting a diminutive
silver watch which her mother had given
her on her tenth birthday. "Why, it's almost
<i>eight</i> o'clock, and the train goes at nine."</p>

<p>Mr. Page laughed. "The cab will not be here
before half-past," he said; "and even then we
shall have more than ample time to reach the
train."</p>

<p>Nellie sighed. "I think I'll go in and see if
I can do anything for mamma," she said.
"This does seem such a dreadfully long
morning."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>"You were up at half-past five," said Mr.
Page. "That is why it seems so long. But we
shall be off pretty soon, and then you will find
time flying. At least I hope so, for we have
quite a journey before us."</p>

<p>When they were seated at last in the train
in which they were to make the first part of
the trip, with the mother well wrapped in her
traveling cloak, the children amused themselves
by looking out of the car windows at the groves
of lemons, oranges, and nuts extending on both
sides of the railroad. Thus an hour passed
quickly, and the station where they were to leave
the train was reached.</p>

<p>"The mountains are beginning already," said
Walter, as they stood on the platform awaiting
the arrival of the stage. It was indeed a wild-looking
spot. Sheer from the road high hills
rose ruggedly, clothed here and there with mesquite
bushes and wild fern, now beginning to
wither through lack of rain.</p>

<p>"Yes, the mountains are beginning, as you
say," remarked Mr. Page. "We shall have
ample opportunity to become acquainted with
them to-day."</p>

<p>As he spoke a buggy, rather dilapidated in
appearance, the horse driven by a Mexican, came
in sight. Mr. Page and his wife had arranged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
to drive in this, thinking it would not be so
fatiguing as riding in the stage.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Juan," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Se&#241;or," the man replied.
"Not very pretty, this, says Se&#241;or Smith, but
comfortable, yes."</p>

<p>"Well, we care more for comfort than beauty
just here and now," rejoined Mr. Page. "Mother,"
he continued, turning to his wife, "are you
ready to drive with me for the eight hours
or so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, not so long, Se&#241;or," said the man. "In
six you will be well at Santa Isabel."</p>

<p>"We do not go so far to-night, I think," said
Mr. Page. "However, that will depend on circumstances."</p>

<p>Mrs. Page was ready. "Shall we start at
once, Ralph?" she inquired. "Or shall we wait
and see the others off first?"</p>

<p>"We ought to go ahead of them," said the
husband; "otherwise we shall have the dust of
the road in our eyes all the way. Those stage
horses make clouds of dust."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we had better go ahead. Let us
wait, though, till the stage arrives. I want to
feel that they are coming just behind us," she
said.</p>

<p>"Here it is now!" shouted Walter.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>"My patience!" exclaimed Aunt Mary.
"What a ramshackle affair it is&mdash;nothing but
a dilapidated covered wagon."</p>

<p>The driver, a thin-faced, dark-skinned young
man with a strong nasal accent, showed a set
of brilliant teeth as he rejoined pleasantly:</p>

<p>"Mebbe it <i>looks</i> ramshackle, miss; but you'll
find it all right as a carrier. There's lots of
folks come up and down <i>oncet</i> or <i>twicet</i> a week
just for the pleasure of ridin' in this here
stage."</p>

<p>With these words he threw the reins over the
backs of the horses and, stepping upon the platform,
prepared to put in the freight and baggage
before seating the passengers. Sack after
sack, box after box, package after package was
deposited in the immense "boot" at the back
of the vehicle; then the space under and between
the seats was filled to its utmost capacity.</p>

<p>"See here," said Mr. Page, who had been
watching the transfer with some concern,
"where are you going to put your passengers?
Or, rather, where are they going to put their
feet? Do you intend to have them sit Turk
fashion on the seats?"</p>

<p>The driver showed his brilliant teeth once
more as he answered, good-humoredly: "Plenty
of room for passengers, mister. I understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
you and the lady are goin' in the buggy. There
won't be no one in the stage, 'ceptin' the other
lady and the little boy and gal and myself.
You ought to see 'em sometimes, settin' on each
other's laps."</p>

<p>"Oh, there's room enough in one way," said
Mr. Page; "but they will have no place to rest
their feet. Why do you crowd the stage with
baggage and freight? Why don't you have an
extra wagon?"</p>

<p>"Ha, ha!" laughed the driver, though not at
all disrespectfully. "That <i>would</i> be a cost&mdash;to
freighters.</p>

<p>"But," he continued, quite seriously, "this is
a larger load of freight and baggage than usual.
There's going to be a party up at Julian to-night,
and there's a good many extras.</p>

<p>"If you'll step in now, ladies," he went on,
turning politely to Aunt Mary and Nellie, "you
can have your choice of seats. The lady can
set in the back with the hull seat to herself,
and she won't have to sit Turk fashion, neither.
The little gal can do the same, and when you
put a robe at your back&mdash;plenty of 'em here&mdash;you'll
be like you was reclinin' on a couch.
Otherwise, I don't deny that if you sit up
straight you'll have your knees at your chin,
for there won't be no other place to put 'em,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
with the boxes and bags on the floor. The little
feller can set with me in front."</p>

<p>Walter sprang into the place allotted him.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he exclaimed. "<i>Our</i> legs are not
going to be cramped. You've got all the baggage
under the other seats behind there."</p>

<p>"That's the way it's got to be," said the
driver gravely. "Got to have my legs free to
steer the ship. Holdin' them mules ain't always
a joke."</p>

<p>"Oh, are they dangerous?" queried Aunt
Mary in alarm, in the act of gathering her
skirts about her to enter the vehicle. Nellie
was already seated sidewise on her perch.</p>

<p>"Not a bit dangerous, ma'am," rejoined the
driver. "Never been an accident on this here
line. But there could be, and there might be
without keerful drivers&mdash;we have 'em on this
route&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And couldn't you, don't you think, dust off
the seats?" asked Aunt Mary, still hesitating,
her skirts in her hands.</p>

<p>The boy here burst into a fit of uncontrollable
mirth. "It's plain to be seen this here's your
first trip to the mountains, ma'am. Why, what
would be the use? Before we get to Witch
Creek we'll be fairly eatin' dust."</p>

<p>With a solemn shake of the head, but making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
no further remarks, Aunt Mary now took her
place. Giving her and Nellie each a heavy
woolen blanket to serve as cushions for their
backs, the driver also prepared to envelop them
in linen robes, to preserve them as much as possible
from the dust they were to "eat" before
nightfall.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't have that thing around me,"
said Nellie, tossing it aside. "I want to be able
to move about. I'm not afraid of the dust."</p>

<p>Mrs. Page, who stood beside her husband
watching the proceedings, was about to remonstrate,
but the husband said:</p>

<p>"Let her alone, Martha. The dust will not
hurt her. The child is right."</p>

<p>The driver nodded his head in approbation
and prepared to take his own seat. "Here
comes the mail," he said, as a short, squat man
approached, carrying a sack on his shoulder.
"We'll be off in a jiffy now."</p>

<p>"There you are, Dingley!" the man called
out as he flung the mail pouch at Walter's feet.</p>

<p>"Come, mother," said Mr. Page, helping his
wife into the buggy; "we must get a start, or
<i>we'll</i> be in for the dust."</p>

<p>"That's so," rejoined Dingley, "that's so.
I'll give ye five minutes' start to forge ahead."</p>

<p>Presently the brisk little buggy horse was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
trotting ahead, and as it turned the first bend
of the road the stage driver touched his mules.
Off they started.</p>

<p>Despite the dust which covered them from
head to foot, even penetrating the luncheon
basket (which they opened about noon by the
side of a tiny, clear spring half hidden amid a
grove of cottonwood trees), the party enjoyed
the ride very much. By the time they reached
Witch Creek, where they intended passing the
night if Mrs. Page felt much fatigued, she
thought herself fully able to push on to Santa
Isabel. From there they would have to make
an early start for the hot springs next morning.</p>

<p>Three miles and a half further on their journey
ended for the day. They had enjoyed every
inch of it, yet were delighted to find themselves,
at the close of the day, in the long, white, one-story
hotel, set invitingly amid a grove of trees
larger than any they had seen in California.
After an appetizing supper they retired to rest.
Everybody slept well, and seven o'clock found
them ready for the road once more.</p>

<p>To the surprise of the children, who thought
they were to make the remainder of their journey
in the company of their friend Dingley,
they learned that such was not the case. He
had continued on his route up to Julian. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
way of our travelers lay in another direction.
It was a delight to step into the spring wagon
awaiting them, to find themselves speeding
along the edge of the foot-hills, through the
broad valley, until, almost before they had become
accustomed to their surroundings, the
driver, pointing to a speck in the distance, apparently
at the very base of a rugged mountain,
announced: "There are the hot springs."</p>

<p>"How close to the mountain they are," said
Walter.</p>

<p>"Not so close as they seem," was the reply.
"They are seven miles distant, but the atmosphere
is so clear that they appear much
nearer."</p>

<p>A sudden turn in the road now hid the village
from view. As they wound on and on it
would reappear and disappear, always under
some new aspect of wild picturesqueness and
beauty.</p>

<p>"You see that highest peak over there, just
above the village?" said the driver, pointing
with his whip. "Well, that is the 'Eagle.' The
two other mountains nearest are called the
'Rabbit' and the 'Squaw.'"</p>

<p>"What lies behind that small mountain chain
at whose foot the village seems to nestle?" inquired
Aunt Mary.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span></p>

<p>"The desert," replied the driver. "Those
hills are all that separate these lands from the
dreariest wastes you ever saw."</p>

<p>Soon they came in sight of small, cultivated
patches of land, whose rich, black soil gave evidence
of its fertility. Adobe houses, with brush
additions, could be seen everywhere. The sound
of falling water pleasantly greeted their ears.</p>

<p>"Is there a waterfall here?" asked Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"No, ma'am," said the driver. "At least, not
a natural waterfall. That sound is made by
the waste water from the bathhouses flowing
into the irrigation ditch, which is used by all
these people in turn to irrigate their lands."</p>

<p>Some one shouted "Hello!" and in a moment
Charlie Dorner was seen approaching. "Turn
in this way, if you please," he said. "I've
found a splendid camping place&mdash;not too sunny,
not too shady, not too close to anybody, yet very
near the baths."</p>

<p>Mrs. Page remained in the wagon, but the
others were soon following Charlie down a short
incline leading to a miniature grove of cottonwoods.
A pair of pepper trees stood guard at
the entrance. The main tent&mdash;there were three&mdash;was
arranged as a sitting-room. Here Mrs.
Page and Aunt Mary and Nellie were to sleep.
During the day their bunks were fastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
the sides of the tent and hidden by curtains.
A large rug covered the boarded floor. Board
floors are somewhat of a luxury among the
Cupa folk, especially the campers.</p>

<p>A table covered by a dark red cloth stood in
the middle. Comfortable camp chairs were
scattered all about. In one of the other tents
Mr. Page and Walter were to sleep, in another
Charlie would take up his quarters.</p>

<p>An abandoned brush-house in the rear, about
fifteen feet square, had been converted into a
kitchen and dining-room, divided by an archway
made of pepper boughs. When Mrs. Page
arrived she was shown to the tent sitting-room.
She pronounced it perfect.</p>

<p>The children, eager to explore the neighborhood,
scarcely took time to unpack their belongings
before they asked to be allowed to go out for
a walk. Permission being given, their father said
he would go along. "Oh, yes, do come, papa,"
said Nellie. "You can show us everything."</p>

<p>"We are now on the outskirts of Cupa," he
said merrily as, after descending the declivity
which led to their camping place, they stood at
the head of a street, or road, with houses
straggling on either side to the number of forty
or fifty. In the distance could be seen flourishing
vineyards and green patches of land.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>Here and there a man was lazily ploughing.
To the left arose a great cloud of steam ascending
slowly into the air, where it was soon lost
in the clear blue.</p>

<p>"There are the springs," said Mr. Page.
"Shall we go down?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, let us go!" cried both children. As
they strolled along the dusty street Walter observed
that he saw only white people.</p>

<p>"Where are the Indians?" he inquired anxiously.
"Have they gone so far away from their
homes that we can't see them at all?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied the father. "On our return,
if we take a short cut to the right, we
shall probably see a good many of them living
in those brush-houses."</p>

<p>And it so proved. After they had gone down
to the springs, surveyed the boiling pools bursting
from the solid granite and taken a drink
from one of them, they returned by the back
road, and found that every brush-house they
passed was inhabited by Indians, in various
stages of comfort or discomfort. These houses
generally stood from fifty to a hundred feet in
the rear of the adobe dwelling, rented for the
season at a good price to the visitors in search
of health or recreation.</p>

<p>The people manifested no curiosity at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
appearance of the strangers; even the Indian
children were stolid and indifferent. Later the
Pages were to learn that the reserve could be
broken when they came to look upon the strangers
as friends. Making a d&#233;tour, the trio advanced
toward the church, which stood on a
slight knoll overlooking the village.</p>

<p>Everything around it was bleak and lean,
the plaster falling from the walls both outside
and inside. They tried to enter, but the door
was locked. Through the windows they could
see the little altar adorned with bright tissue-paper
flowers. There appeared to be no one in
the vicinity, and Walter, in a spirit of mischief,
picked up a stick from the ground and touched
the bell which hung in front of the door on
two heavy crossbeams, gnarled and worm-eaten.</p>

<p>"Walter, you should not have done that,"
said the father, as a single, sharp, clear note
resounded through the air.</p>

<p>"It is what they all do," said a boyish voice
back of him. "It is a beautiful sound, don't
you think?"</p>

<p>"Where did you come from, my boy?" asked
Mr. Page as the young stranger advanced. He
was about Walter's age, clad in blue overalls and
flannel shirt. The battered felt hat which served
him as head covering was held in his hand.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>"I live there," he replied, pointing to a
ruined adobe house at some distance behind the
church. "I live there with Mauricio. He is my
uncle. He is the priest."</p>

<p>"The priest!" exclaimed Mr. Page. "And
living in such a place! Are you not an Indian
boy?" he continued, looking at the swarthy skin,
black eyes and raven hair. "Surely you are an
Indian, and there are no Indian priests, in this
country, at least."</p>

<p>"He is not a real priest, my uncle," replied
the boy. "But that is what they call him&mdash;the
Protestants, I mean. I told you that way
just for fun."</p>

<p>He was smiling broadly, showing his white
teeth, and his eyes twinkled merrily.</p>

<p>"How did you know we were Catholics?" inquired
Mr. Page rather gravely, not very well
pleased at this facetiousness.</p>

<p>"I saw you kneel in front of the church, I
saw you make the sign of the cross; and I knew
then that you did not come to make fun, as so
many do."</p>

<p>"But why do <i>you</i> make fun and tell us your
uncle is a priest when he is not one? Where is
he now?"</p>

<p>"He is away at Palomas&mdash;at the sheep-shearing,"
said the boy. "I will tell it to you what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
I mean. My uncle takes care for the church&mdash;the
Father comes not often here any more, and
every Sunday my uncle rings the bell, or sometimes
I do, and the people come, and he says
the prayers aloud. And that is why the people
who do not know about Catholics call him the
priest. We let them do; we don't care. They
don't know much&mdash;some of them."</p>

<p>"You speak English very well," said Walter.</p>

<p>"And why not?" answered the boy. "I have
been to school six years at Deming, at the Mission.
Maybe I go back in the fall, I don't
know."</p>

<p>"What is your name?" inquired Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"I am called Francisco Perez," was the reply.
"I will fetch water for you, or wood, or do
anything that I can do, and I will not charge
you much. Oh, I can do many things, for I
have been to the Mission to school."</p>

<p>"Are there many boys here?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"What kind of boys?" questioned Francisco.
"White boys, or Indian?"</p>

<p>"Oh, any kind."</p>

<p>"Just now there are no white boys but you.
Maybe some will come. And not many Indians,
either. Many are gone to Mesa Grande and
around there, picking berries and cherries, and
then there will be the grape picking."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you play with us sometimes and show
us places?" continued Walter.</p>

<p>Francisco laughed. "I do not play much,"
he said, "and there are not places to show.
You see how it is," with a swing of his hand
over the valley. "But I will do what I can."</p>

<p>"We are camping down there," said Mr. Page,
pointing to the three white tents in the midst
of the cottonwood grove.</p>

<p>"You have the best place. In a week you
could not have got there, for others are coming
soon and would have taken it."</p>

<p>"Well, come down, Francisco, and we'll see
what we can do," said Mr. Page. "You look
like a good boy, and Walter will want a companion.
Good-by for the present."</p>

<p>"<i>Adios</i>," said Francisco, retracing his steps
to his ruined dwelling and, the children noticed,
not once looking back, though they followed him
with their eyes until he disappeared within the
doorless opening to his home. When they got
back to camp Charlie was waiting with a dinner
of fried rabbit, potatoes, fresh tomatoes, and
melons purchased from the Indians that morning.
As they sat in the brush dining-room, within
sound of the pleasant waterfall, around the well-spread
table, all were unanimous in declaring
that the viands could not have been surpassed.</p>

<p>"I suggest that we all take a little <i>siesta</i>,"
said Aunt Mary after dinner. "We shall feel
much better for the rest of the day if we do."</p>

<p>The children looked at each other. Siestas
had not entered into their plans at all.</p>

<p>"We don't have to, do we, mother?" asked
Walter. "You know Nellie and I never do
such a dreadful thing at home."</p>

<p>"What do you purpose doing?" inquired
their father.</p>

<p>"Oh, we didn't know," said Walter. "We
thought of going down to the springs again and
watching the people bathe."</p>

<p>"They don't <i>bathe</i> in the pools from which
they drink, surely," said Aunt Mary in disgust.
"Don't tell me they do that, Walter."</p>

<p>"I thought there was another pool," said
Walter. "I'm certain I heard them say something
about washing down there this morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, that man was speaking of the laundry
where the women wash the clothes," said Mr.
Page. "He said it was quite interesting to
watch them."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>"Bother!" said Walter. "I thought there
was a pool for bathing, and that we might paddle
about in it, just as we used to do at Ti
Juana. But, anyhow, Nellie and I don't want
to take any <i>siesta</i>, do we, Nellie?"</p>

<p>His sister shook her head. "Just let's go out
and ramble around," she said. "We'll find
something to amuse us."</p>

<p>"There is something already," said Mr. Page,
as the clear note of a bird broke upon the midday
stillness. Soft and sweet it trilled, then
loud and shrill, then quivered down to a melancholy
note, and again gradually ascended, terminating
in one long, beautiful, slowly-dying
tremolo.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> can that be?" cried Mrs. Page. "It
seems almost like an angel's song. I have never
heard anything like it."</p>

<p>"It is only me&mdash;Francisco," said a boyish
voice on the outside, while a pair of bright eyes
peered in between the interstices of the sylvan
dining-room.</p>

<p>"Come in, come in!" cried Walter, hurrying
from his place. "I want mother to see you."</p>

<p>"Mother," he continued, as the boy entered
slowly, cap in hand, "this is Francisco, our
friend whom we met near the church this morning.
Is there anything he can do?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Page extended her slim white hand.
The boy took it and said: "I can work very well.
I could fetch water."</p>

<p>"I do not believe there is anything you <i>could</i>
do," replied Mrs. Page. "We have a man who
does all we require. We shall not need any
carrying of water, I think. I see there are
hydrants not far away."</p>

<p>"Oh, but that is not to drink&mdash;that water.
It is not so <i>very</i> good," said Francisco. "But
farther up, about half a mile, or maybe a little
more, there is a beautiful spring. <i>That</i> is nice
and cold and good to drink. Some carry it in
buckets, but I would fetch it on a little wagon,
in a barrel. And I can give you another barrel
in which to keep it. Out there under the largest
pepper tree it would be very good."</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Charlie?" asked Mr. Page.
"Francisco tells us he can bring very good
drinking water. It will be an excellent plan,
I think, so let him do it."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Charlie, appearing from the
other end of the room. "I was going to ask
what we should do about drinking water. That
which comes through the pipe just above here
is very warm. The hill being so bare is always
sunny. I've seen people bringing that other
water right along."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Page turned to Francisco. "You have
a horse, then?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we have two horses. Shall I get
my wagon? Will you like the water? I can
bring the barrel along for you."</p>

<p>"Very well; go and fetch it," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, may I go with him?" pleaded
Walter.</p>

<p>"To the spring? Yes; if he is willing to take
you," replied his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, I meant to ask. And the little girl
maybe, too, if she will," said Francisco.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; yes, mamma, let me go," Nellie
begged.</p>

<p>"Very well," both replied, but Aunt Mary
said:</p>

<p>"Don't you think it rather tomboyish, to use
a mild word, to go about that way with two
boys?"</p>

<p>"One of them is her brother, Aunt Mary,"
hastily interjected Walter. "Nellie has always
played with boys."</p>

<p>"It won't harm the child a bit," said Mr.
Page.</p>

<p>Francisco smiled and said:</p>

<p>"The horse is very slow. He cannot hurt.
He is an old one, mine. Once he was turned out
to die, and I begged for him. So my uncle gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
him. And he helps earn me my living now.
When you see him I think you will laugh; but
he is very good, as I said, my Rosinante."</p>

<p>"Where did you hear that name?" inquired
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"A gentleman told me to call that name to
my horse. He said there was a story about it&mdash;in
Spanish."</p>

<p>"Don Quixote," said Aunt Mary pleasantly.
"Did you ever hear about it?"</p>

<p>"Only that the bones of a horse were once
coming through the skin," replied Francisco.
"And so it was with mine. But now he is not
so bad. I will go quickly and bring the cart."</p>

<p>Walter looked at his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, go along," said Mr. Page. "Nellie
will wait until you come back."</p>

<p>"But about the money&mdash;I was forgetting,"
said Francisco. "Is it too much for every barrel
to pay twenty-five cents?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. It is quite reasonable," said
Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"There will be perhaps two every week."</p>

<p>"That will be all right."</p>

<p>"Very good," said Francisco.</p>

<p>The two boys left the tent, beginning a lively
race with each other at once. Francisco soon
outdistanced Walter, but magnanimously refusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
to presume on his superior skill, waited for
him under an oak tree which stood, beautiful
and solitary, in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>"You are a fine runner, Francisco," said Walter,
when he arrived.</p>

<p>"I was best at the Mission," the boy replied.
"At the Fiestas we always run, and, of the boys,
Juan Palos and me&mdash;we most always get the
prize."</p>

<p>"When do you have the Fiesta?"</p>

<p>"Oh, in October, on the third&mdash;the Feast of
San Francisco. It is his church, you see. But
this year there will not be any, for the people
will need to save their money if they must go
away to some other place."</p>

<p>"It is too bad that they have to go," said
Walter.</p>

<p>"You think it is true, then? there is no hope?
What thinks your father?"</p>

<p>"He says they will have to leave. But the
government will find them some other place."</p>

<p>"It will be hard," said the boy, "and it is not
just. But, if it must be, it must."</p>

<p>"I wish I could see a Fiesta. What do they
have?"</p>

<p>"Oh, first Mass and Benediction; and the
people are married, and the children get baptized.
Afterward they have games, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
dance. Once, for three years the priest did not
come, because they would not give up the gambling."</p>

<p>"Do Indians gamble?" asked Walter, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they do, and very much. They
lose a great deal of money that way. But from
the whites they have learned it, I believe."</p>

<p>Walter did not know what reply to make to
this assertion, doubtless a true one. They
walked at a quick pace till they reached the
ruined adobe, Francisco's home, behind which
stood the wagon&mdash;three or four long, unplaned
boards set on four wheels. The horse was grazing
some distance away.</p>

<p>"I will catch Rosinante," said Francisco, taking
an armful of hay from a pile.</p>

<p>"If you are thirsty there is, inside, a clean
cup, and there at the other end, by the tree, an
<i>otla</i> with water."</p>

<p>Walter felt quite thirsty. Moreover, he was
somewhat curious to see the inside of a genuine
Indian dwelling. It seemed very dark to him,
coming out of the hot, bright sunshine. There
was a window facing the door, but every pane of
glass was gone. The sill was so wide as to form
a very comfortable seat. The thick walls and
smooth earthen floor made the place feel very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
cool. The room contained very little furniture&mdash;two
cots, one at either end; in the middle a table,
with clean plates, cups and saucers; also a couple
of boxes and a pair of broken chairs. The house
was almost roofless, save for the withered boughs
which had been laid across the broad, irregular
openings. Nothing could have been more humble;
yet everything was clean and orderly.</p>

<p>Francisco came with Rosinante as Walter was
replacing the cup.</p>

<p>"That is very good water," he said.</p>

<p>"The same as you will have to drink," replied
Francisco. "See, here is your barrel. I thought
it better to take but one. I can change twice a
week. Now I will harness Rosinante."</p>

<p>This was soon done; the barrel was placed on
the wagon and fastened with a couple of thongs.
Walter took his place beside Francisco, and they
rattled away, down the hill. Nellie was on the
watch; when they reached the tent Francisco
and Walter got off and told her to take their
place, saying they would drive her up the hill,
but that she would have to walk down. "The
full barrel of water is quite enough for Rosinante,
Francisco says," explained Walter. "Besides,
if the thongs that tie the barrel to the
wagon should break, it might fall over on you
and kill you."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>

<p>The whole family stood at the door of the
large tent to see them off, Nellie gaily waving
her hand to them.</p>

<p>"Is there not some danger that they may fall
into the boiling spring?" asked Aunt Mary,
anxiously, as they passed out of sight.</p>

<p>Aunt Mary was the widow of Mr. Page's
uncle. He could not help smiling, occasionally,
at her causeless fears.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you will not enjoy your trip
unless you try to be less fearful of accidents,"
he said. "They are not going in the direction
of the hot springs. However, they would not
be injured if they did fall in. They could clamber
out at once. You must come down with me
after a while to see the springs."</p>

<p>"I think I shall wait until Martha is able to
go," said Aunt Mary; "perhaps to-morrow. If
the odor when one is near is any worse, or even
as bad, as the whiffs we get of it here, I should
not think people could either drink the water or
bathe in it."</p>

<p>"One gets to like it after a while," said Mr.
Page. "I have heard that after a sojourn here
people can not bear to drink cold water for some
time."</p>

<p>"I am already longing for a cool drink," said
his wife.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"The children will not be gone very long, I
think," rejoined her husband.</p>

<p>The trio were enjoying themselves very much
at that moment. Francisco was hailed by several
persons with the reminder that their water-barrels
were almost empty, and to each demand
he replied courteously that he would attend to
it. Turning off from the road, they crossed the
path which led to the pools, and were soon on
a rough, uneven highway, stony and bleak. A
few moments brought them to a sharp divide,
which they skirted for some distance till they
came to a place where the steep sides were worn
away by wagon wheels. On the other side of
this ca&#241;on everything was green and luxuriant,
in remarkable contrast to the ground they had
just left. A well-worn trail wound in and out
among the trees, which grew closer together as
they ascended the verdant slope. A tiny stream,
seemingly not broader than a silver ribbon, trickled
along to meet them.</p>

<p>"Now we are there," said Francisco, at length,
pausing under the shade of a magnificent oak
tree.</p>

<p>"Isn't it lovely!" cried Nellie, springing from
the wagon.</p>

<p>To the left, from a granite boulder, a living
stream of water was trickling, forming a miniature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
pool. Francisco, with great dexterity,
steered his wagon beneath the stream in such
a position that the water would flow into the
upright barrel.</p>

<p>"Let us go now a little while the water
is filling, and look about," he said to the
children. "It is very pretty here." And so it
was.</p>

<p>They climbed up the bank, pushing the fragrant
bushes aside, and came suddenly upon a
broad plateau of many acres, dotted at intervals
with splendid forest trees. In the distance the
rugged, blue mountains stretched along the
horizon. All was radiant, still, and incomparably
lovely.</p>

<p>The children ran about for a time, then seated
themselves under one of the massive trees. Presently
they heard a crashing noise in the bushes,
and a red head appeared. In a moment they
saw that it belonged to a boy about Walter's age,
a most ungainly and unattractive-looking person.
His eyes were small and close together,
his teeth uneven and protruding.</p>

<p>"Hello!" he cried as he saw Walter and Nellie;
then, catching sight of Francisco, he made
a horrible face.</p>

<p>The Indian boy looked at him calmly, but
said nothing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello!" he repeated, throwing himself on
the ground beside Walter.</p>

<p>"Hello!" responded Walter, coolly. He did
not like the aspect of the newcomer any more
than he did his attitude toward Francisco.</p>

<p>"When did you get here?" inquired the red-haired
boy, "and how long are you going to
stay?"</p>

<p>"We came this morning, and we may stay all
summer," replied Walter.</p>

<p>The boy edged nearer him. Francisco got up
and walked away, followed by Nellie.</p>

<p>"Isn't he horrid?" she said when they got
out of hearing-distance.</p>

<p>"Never mind. I will tell you after," said
Francisco, "when he is gone. I do not care
what he will say about me. If you like, I will
make you a staff. It is easier to walk up and
down these hills with one."</p>

<p>"I'd rather you would make one for mamma,"
said Nellie.</p>

<p>"I will make for her one, too."</p>

<p>"I will make for her one-two," said a mocking
voice behind them. "You can't speak English&mdash;you
can't. Why don't you talk Indian?"</p>

<p>Francisco turned sharply around. Walter
and the unwelcome visitor were just behind
them, Walter evidently bent on quitting him.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>"If I talked Indian you could not understand
me," said Francisco, pausing squarely in front
of the red-haired tormentor; "but if I knock
you down Indian, then perhaps you will understand."</p>

<p>"Oh, boys, don't fight," began Nellie, in
alarm. "Papa will never let us come out here
again if you do. Please, boys."</p>

<p>"He dasn't fight. He's afraid. He had to
promise he wouldn't. His priest won't let him,
he won't. He's an old Catholic, he is."</p>

<p>"So are we Catholics," cried Walter, pausing
and setting his feet squarely apart. "We <i>all</i> are
Catholics."</p>

<p>"Like that Indian?" scornfully inquired the
other, pointing to Francisco, who now came,
with flashing eyes, closer to Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, like that Indian," Walter replied, unabashed.
"Who's meddling with you? Get off
here this minute, or I'll make you."</p>

<p>"Boys, boys," pleaded Nellie again, "please
don't fight. Let him go."</p>

<p>"I've got as good a right here as any of you
old Catholics," sneered their antagonist; but it
was noticeable that he gradually backed away as
he spoke.</p>

<p>Once more he made a repulsive face; then he
began to sing, in a nasal voice:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">"Indian, Indian, never die&mdash;</div>
<div class="i0">Yellow skin and mean eye,</div>
<div class="i0">Black&mdash;&mdash;"</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<p>He did not finish the stanza. Francisco
sprang forward, seized him about the waist, and
rolled him down the bank.</p>

<p>"There! Finish your song where no one can
hear it but yourself," said the Indian, calmly
returning to his companions. Shouts of anger,
followed by whimpers of pain, came up from
below.</p>

<p>"Oh, Francisco," exclaimed Nellie, "if you
haven't hurt him very much, I think I am
glad."</p>

<p>"Hurt him!" echoed Walter. "That wouldn't
hurt a fly&mdash;such an easy setting-down as he
got."</p>

<p>"I did not hurt him, and I would not. I
was not so angry with him, as that he makes
me tired. I do not like to see him where I am.
He might have followed us for a long time else."</p>

<p>"But maybe he'll be waiting for us down there
to fight," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"No, he will not," answered the Indian boy.
"He is a coward. He will go off home as quickly
as he can. And then, maybe, some day when I
am passing where I can not see him, he will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
throw a stone. Oh, I know him very well.
What did he say to you, Walter, when we walked
away?"</p>

<p>"He said: 'Do you play with <i>Indians</i>?'"</p>

<p>"And what did you say?"</p>

<p>"'Go away&mdash;no one asked you to come
here,' I said. Then I got up and he followed
me."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="small">THE MISSIONARY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Ah, the water overflows," said Francisco, as
they once more came in sight of the spring. He
hurried down the bank, turned the horse round,
tightened the thongs holding the barrel so that
it would stand firmly on the wagon, and the
boys began to retrace their steps.</p>

<p>As soon as they were on level ground again,
Francisco, with the reins in his hand, the other
two walking beside him, pointed to a frame
dwelling a little removed from the others at the
top of a little hill.</p>

<p>"You see that house?" he said. "It is where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
he lives&mdash;that boy. He came last month, with
his mother and sister. They tell that the lady
is a missionary from India. Have you heard
of women doing like that?"</p>

<p>He looked earnestly at the two children,
awaiting their reply.</p>

<p>"In the Protestant churches they do send
women to far countries as missionaries," rejoined
Walter.</p>

<p>"That is funny," replied Francisco, reflectingly.
"It may be well, if they are savages in
India; but here we do not want them, I think."</p>

<p>"Are they here to convert the Indians?" asked
Nellie.</p>

<p>"For the good waters, they say&mdash;but maybe,
too, for other things. Oh, I tell you, we have
plenty of such people in the summer. But they
can not hurt very much.</p>

<p>"One day I was going for water, just like
now," he continued. "The horse I could not
find. After a while I saw this boy riding him
bareback, and I said to him: 'You ride pretty
well, but it is my horse, and I want him!' But
he made one of his faces, and said he would not
get off, and called me a dirty Indian. Then I
pulled him off, and he struck me. After that
I knocked him down, and my uncle came out
from the house and said it was wrong to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
so&mdash;that it was never known that the Indians
quarreled with the whites at the Springs. So
then I made my excuse to the boy and promised
I would not quarrel again; but my uncle said
to him that he must not take my horse again.
And then he mocked my uncle; and I was going
to hit him, but my uncle held me, and he said:
'Go away, boy. You are not a good boy.'"</p>

<p>"And then what did he do?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"He put out his tongue, and just as he did
so a lady came from around the corner by the
church. She stopped and said: 'My son, that
is not polite. You must not let the savages
teach you how to behave.'"</p>

<p>"I'm sure you got angry again then, didn't
you?" said Walter.</p>

<p>"Well, I did, and my uncle a little, too. He
spoke for me. He said we were not savages, but
Christian people. As he was speaking, that boy
had picked up a stone, and, sneaking behind my
uncle, he hit him in the back of the head. Once
more I was going to fight with him, but my
uncle took my arm, and he said: 'Promise me
you will not strike that boy, either now or ever!'
I promised, and we went away and left them.
That is all&mdash;except that sometimes, when he sees
me, he tries very hard to make me angry."</p>

<p>"He'd better not talk very much to me," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Walter. "I'm not afraid of him. If I gave him
one good lamming, I guess he'd stop."</p>

<p>"You must not <i>think</i> of quarreling with him,
Walter," said Nellie.</p>

<p>"I sha'n't, if he lets me alone," her brother
replied. "But if he turns out to be a nagger,
I'll settle him, once and for all."</p>

<p>"Would you like to see the <i>Lavenderia</i>?"
asked Francisco, as a company of Indian women
passed them with huge bundles thrown across
their shoulders.</p>

<p>"What is that?" Nellie inquired.</p>

<p>"What you call washing-house&mdash;laundry," replied
the boy. "They are going now to wash.
All day long, from early, early morning, they
come. For so it must be. They have to wash
the clothes, but all cannot do it at once; so one
week a few come in the early morning, and
others later; and the next week the late ones
come first. But always, except on Sunday, until
night they are washing."</p>

<p>"Shall we leave the water here and go now?"
asked Nellie.</p>

<p>"I think not," replied Francisco. "It is
better first to leave the water at your camp;
then you can sit on the wagon again, and your
brother and I will walk beside."</p>

<p>"Let's hurry up, then," said Nellie. "I just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
love to watch those women as they trot along.
But why don't the men help them carry those
heavy bundles."</p>

<p>Francisco regarded her for a moment with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Carry clothes to the wash?" he said. "It is
not men's work&mdash;that."</p>

<p>Nellie did not reply. She was not going to
quarrel with Francisco. But in her kind little
heart she thought the noble Indian wanting in
chivalry to the weaker sex.</p>

<p>Everyone at the camp was glad to see them;
they had been gone exactly an hour and a half.</p>

<p>"You can't make an Indian hurry," Charlie
had said when Mrs. Page began to grow uneasy.
"Nothing can happen to the young folk; the boy
is all right, and they're nothing but children."</p>

<p>Francisco led the horse to the back of the
large tent, and with Charlie's assistance placed
the barrel under the pepper tree; a gourd-dipper
was produced from Charlie's countless stores,
and everyone had a drink of the delightful, cool
water.</p>

<p>"If you will take a piece of cheese-cloth," said
Francisco, "and, running a string through, tie
it around the top of the barrel, wetting it always,
it will keep cool the water, and the flies
away."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span></p>

<p>"A very good idea, Francisco," said Aunt
Mary, preparing to go in search of the cheese-cloth,
needle, and tape, at once.</p>

<p>"And now, if we may, I will take them to
see the <i>Lavenderia</i>," said the Indian boy. "They
wish to look at the washing going on."</p>

<p>"I don't care so much for it, but Nellie does,"
said Walter.</p>

<p>"You do so&mdash;every bit as much as I do&mdash;Walter,"
rejoined Nellie. "Only you think it's
like a girl to go and see them washing."</p>

<p>"No; it isn't that," said Walter, when everybody
had finished laughing. "But maybe they
won't like our looking at them."</p>

<p>"They are probably used to it by this time,"
said Mr. Page. "People have been watching
them for many years."</p>

<p>Up and down the hills they clattered briskly
once more with the wagon, Rosinante doing her
best to make a record for speed, with Nellie behind
her. When they reached the top of the
hill above the first spring, they left the wagon
and scrambled down the steep, rocky pathway.
At some little distance from the others, a separate
pool for washing had been roofed over very
picturesquely. It reminded one of old pictures of
Hygeian temples. The sides were open, allowing
the looker-on to see the washerwomen, squatting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
on their heels, soaping the clothes or leaning
over the steaming water. Young and old,
to the number of perhaps a dozen, they worked
and chattered, apparently altogether oblivious
of those who regarded them.</p>

<p>Flat granite slabs served them for washboards.
Vigorously, indeed, did they ply their
arms. Some were rinsing, a few wringing out,
and others spreading the garments, white as
snow, either on the ground or on the straggling
bushes in the vicinity.</p>

<p>"I could watch them forever," said Nellie,
when Walter, having made a little journey
around the place with Francisco, told her he
thought they should be going campward. "I'm
going to ask mamma to let me come down here
to-morrow and wash some napkins."</p>

<p>"Would they allow her to wash there?" asked
Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, if she would like; anyone can," said
Francisco. "But always, I think, the white
people come about from ten to twelve in the
morning."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wouldn't like that," said Nellie. "I
want to go with the Indians and wash."</p>

<p>"Maybe you can do that, too," said Francisco.
"Some time, when my cousin Leonidas is coming,
I will ask that you may go along."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span></p>

<p>"You must not forget it, Francisco," said
Nellie, reluctantly tearing herself away.</p>

<p>"Hi! hi! Chrysantha!" called Francisco to
an old woman who waved her hand at them as
they passed. Then he said something in Spanish.
The old woman spoke to her companions.
They all laughed merrily, nodding pleasantly to
the children, and the old woman called out
something several times to Francisco.</p>

<p>"What do they mean? What is she saying?"
asked Nellie, looking back at them shyly.</p>

<p>"They are telling me you will be welcome to
wash with them whenever you wish," said the
boy. "They like you."</p>

<p>Arrived at the tent, Nellie admitted that she
was tired. But Walter begged to be allowed to
go back on the wagon with Francisco, who had
to fetch some eggs to a lady in the village and
draw some more water before evening.</p>

<p>Rosinante jogging leisurely along, they soon
came in sight of the old adobe. The figure of
a woman standing in the rear of the church at
once attracted the attention of Francisco.</p>

<p>"It is the missionary lady!" he exclaimed.
"It is the mother of William. She has come
to say something about what has happened.
How I wish she would stay away!"</p>

<p>The woman came forward to meet them. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
was smiling; evidently she had not yet had an
interview with her hopeful son.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged glances. Francisco
breathed more freely.</p>

<p>"I am pleased to see that you are in a better
humor to-day," she said sweetly. "And who is
your companion?"</p>

<p>"My name is Walter Page," was the response.
"I live in San Diego."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you? I have a dear friend there&mdash;the
Reverend Mr. Binder. At present he is not
serving any church. Like myself, he has been a
missionary, and his health failed. Perhaps you
have met him, my boy."</p>

<p>"I don't know any ministers," said Walter,
rather brusquely. "We go to the Catholic
church."</p>

<p>The lady's face grew more stern. She looked
from one boy to the other.</p>

<p>"You never go to Sunday-school, then," she
said in regretful tones, but as if stating an
undeniable fact.</p>

<p>"I go every Sunday," said Walter.</p>

<p>"Does your priest allow it?"</p>

<p>"He teaches us," rejoined Walter.</p>

<p>"That must be something new&mdash;something
entirely new."</p>

<p>Walter made no reply.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<p>"It was my purpose, in coming here, to establish
a Sunday-school," the missionary continued,
true to her avocation. "I saw this boy and
marked him," pointing to Francisco. "He
looked intelligent, as though the others might
follow his lead. But unfortunately he got into
an altercation with my son, and I have taken
no further steps with him."</p>

<p>Walter looked down, embarrassed upon hearing
himself addressed personally. He hoped she
was not going to ask him to be a leader. He
would in that case tell her something, he now
thought.</p>

<p>"It is difficult, very difficult, to accomplish
anything. The mothers and fathers are indifferent,
if not rude&mdash;the children the same."</p>

<p>Neither of the boys made a reply.</p>

<p>"The teacher tells me she has been here
twelve years," went on the missionary, after
waiting in vain for a remark. Her voice now
began to lose its sweet accents and to savor of
asperity.</p>

<p>"Twelve years&mdash;and she has not been able to
make any impression&mdash;in a Christian way. She
thinks you are all very good, but you cling to
your old beliefs."</p>

<p>"And why not, please?" asked Francisco.
"Why should we not keep to our own faith?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Why do they give us teachers who are not of
our religion? How many go there to that
school?" pointing to the building, not far away.
"Maybe twenty out of seventy-five children. To
the Mission go the others, where they belong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I think it is very cruel in the priests to
insist on sending those children nearly a hundred
miles from their parents to the Mission,"
said William's mother, growing warmer with
every word.</p>

<p>"And the Indians think it is <i>right</i>&mdash;<i>right</i> to
send them to the Mission, where they will learn
their religion," answered Francisco with equal
warmth. "The teacher is very good and kind,
and the people are grateful to her for all she
does, but if she should stay here twelve years
longer, they will never give up what the Fathers
have taught them."</p>

<p>"It is well, it is very well, my poor child,"
rejoined the missionary, compassionately, "that
all whom she does teach are not so high-tempered
as you are. What a time there would be in the
school!"</p>

<p>"Why do you not leave us alone?" cried
Francisco. "Do we trouble you? Do we try
to make Catholics of you who come to our home
here? Why do you not leave us alone?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<p>Walter was alarmed. He looked at his companion
in surprise. The missionary drew back.</p>

<p>"Do not become violent," she said. "In
India the natives were at least respectful. I
wonder that your parents are not more careful
of you than they are," she went on, turning to
Walter. "They should not allow you to associate
with such a rude person."</p>

<p>The boy's cheek flushed; he turned away
without replying.</p>

<p>"Come, Francisco," he said in a low tone,
pulling his companion by the sleeve. "Come;
let us go into the house."</p>

<p>"I do not wonder you should wish to go away,
my boy. You are probably ashamed of the conduct
of your friend. I hope, at least, that you
are."</p>

<p>"I am not ashamed," said Walter. "Neither
of us is. We have no reason to be ashamed."</p>

<p>"You have been badly brought up," continued
their tormentor. "You have been badly brought
up&mdash;very badly."</p>

<p>They waited to hear no more, but walked quietly
onward until they found shelter within the
crumbling doorway of the brown, smoky adobe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="small">AT CHURCH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>True to his Indian nature, Francisco made
no further allusion to the episode with the missionary.
After unharnessing Rosinante, he began
searching for eggs. When he and Walter had
found a couple of dozen, he placed them in an
old tin pail and said:</p>

<p>"I will let the horse rest now for an hour,
and then I must go to the spring for a barrel
of water again. But first, if you like to come
with me, I will take these eggs to the lady that
lives in the doctor's house."</p>

<p>"Have you a doctor here?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Not now," Francisco hastened to say. "But
once, for three years, we had. There was also
a woman they called a matron to teach our
women to sew and keep house. How funny that
was&mdash;how funny! They would not give us our
own teachers&mdash;the Sisters, or some Catholics.
They sent us a teacher&mdash;who is kind, but who
hates the Catholic religion&mdash;and another man
and woman, the doctor and matron, who had
nothing at all to do to earn their good salary
of seventy-five dollars a month. It was <i>too</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
plain&mdash;that fraud&mdash;my uncle said, and so they
took them away. But altogether they cost as
much as would have kept <i>ten</i> sisters in the
place."</p>

<p>They were passing the church now, and Walter
said:</p>

<p>"See, Francisco, the window is open. It was
not when my father and Nellie and I came up
this morning."</p>

<p>"You did not open it?" asked the Indian
boy, setting down his pail.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," replied Walter. "We would
not do such a thing."</p>

<p>"It is kept always shut&mdash;the church," said
Francisco. "I must look in."</p>

<p>He leaned across the sill; then, after lightly
vaulting over, he said:</p>

<p>"Who has done this?"</p>

<p>"What?" eagerly inquired Walter, following
him.</p>

<p>Francisco pointed to the walls. At regular
intervals, where the stations are usually hung,
colored scriptural prints had been placed, each
fastened with a large pin, as they were unframed.
They were scenes from the New Testament,
in themselves rather pretty, and not
inappropriate as illustrations of texts of Scripture.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>"They are pretty, but they are not suitable
for the stations," said Walter.</p>

<p>"I think it must be the missionary woman
who has done this," said Francisco. "I will not
take them down. I will ask some older person
to do so. Perhaps my uncle will be home for
Sunday. She did not do it for good, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Perhaps she did, Francisco," said Walter.
"We ought not to be too hard on her."</p>

<p>"Maybe; but I know them. We shall see.
Anyhow, it is not right for her to come into the
church by the window like a thief. She knew
very well, I think, that we would not want her
to hang her pictures around."</p>

<p>Closing the window again, Francisco took up
his pail of eggs. The boys parted under the
old oak, Walter fearing his father and mother
would not like him to remain away longer.</p>

<p>He learned that his mother had taken her
first hot bath and was feeling "quite well," she
said. The older people were very much interested
in his recital of the encounter with the
missionary, but reproved Walter for having answered
her as he had done.</p>

<p>"But, papa," he said, "I couldn't help it.
I had to say something, and I wasn't going to
give in to her by acting as if we were wrong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
or that I was ashamed of being a Catholic. You
would not have wished me to do that."</p>

<p>There was reason in his argument the elders
admitted. His father added, however, that it
was always better to steer clear of such persons
if possible.</p>

<p>And so the day, so full of incident, closed.
Supper was hardly over before the tired children
went to rest.</p>

<p>So day succeeded day in this primitive mountain
village. The children gradually became acquainted
with the Indians, who were very kind
to them. Nellie now went regularly to the
<i>Lavenderia</i> with handkerchiefs and napkins, and
the Indian women willingly made a place for
her. They laughingly watched her attempts at
washing, which was generally accomplished for
her by one or another of them in the end. The
gold medal of the Immaculate Conception,
which she wore attached to a thin chain around
her neck, was the sign of a bond of kinship
between them.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning at eight o'clock the
sweet, pure tones of the church-bell rang out
upon the air, sounding singularly beautiful
through the clear, still atmosphere.</p>

<p>"There will not be Mass to-day, Walter?"
inquired Mr. Page of his son, whose intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
with Francisco he thought warranted him well
posted in the affairs of the village.</p>

<p>"No, sir," was the reply. "If Mauricio,
Francisco's uncle, has returned, he will say the
prayers, and if he hasn't, someone else will."</p>

<p>"We must go, at any rate," said his father.
"It will be, I imagine, both devotional and interesting
to assist at the prayers."</p>

<p>Mrs. Page was unable to walk so far. Aunt
Mary, glad of an excuse for avoiding close proximity
to the Indians, toward whom she had an
aversion which she could not conquer, decided to
remain at home to keep her company.</p>

<p>From all directions groups of Indians&mdash;the
women and children cleanly, if gaudily, attired&mdash;were
wending their way to the church. The
last bell began to ring as they climbed the steep
elevation on top of which it stood. The people
sat around the entrance; on the ground several
very old women were crouched, motionless and
patient.</p>

<p>Francisco came from the inside and opened
wide the door. The congregation poured in&mdash;the
men on one side, the women on the other.
Nearly all the latter had shawls over their
heads, few being without a tinge of red in their
costumes. After Francisco had lighted two candles
on the altar, an old woman left her place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and went forward, kneeling on the steps of the
little sanctuary. She recited the Rosary in
Spanish, the people responding in low but distinct
and reverent tones. After she had said
one decade, she began another, reversing the
prayers, saying the "Holy Mary," first, the
people answering with the "Hail, Mary." The
third decade was repeated in the usual manner,
the fourth like the second. At the fifth, instead
of praying as before, she lowered her voice to a
sweet, monotonous chant.</p>

<p>"<i>Dios te salve, Maria</i>," she sang, and the
others answered in the same fashion, "<i>Santa
Maria, Madre de Dios</i>," till the decade was
ended. It was all very strange and beautiful;
the sweet voices of the dark-skinned worshipers,
deprived of their priests and teachers, coming
Sunday after Sunday thus to preserve and perpetuate
the services of their religion. Other
prayers, also in Spanish, were said, and the old
woman returned to her place.</p>

<p>Francisco was about to extinguish the candles,
when the door of the sacristy opened, and a tall,
finely-formed Indian, about fifty years of age,
issued forth. The boy stepped aside; the newcomer
advanced to the railing. His sharp eyes
seemed to rest at once upon the pictures which
had been placed on the walls during the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
week. He addressed the people in Spanish;
then, pointing to the pictures, asked in
English:</p>

<p>"Who can tell the person who has hung those
pictures around the walls of the church?"</p>

<p>No one answered. The Indians, whispering
among themselves, made various gestures of disapproval.</p>

<p>"You will all see that although they are very
good pictures," he continued, "they are not for
our church. We do not need them. We have
here already the Sacred Hearts of Our Lord and
His Mother; a kind lady would have given us
also the stations, but for the removal which we
must soon make from this&mdash;our home."</p>

<p>Here those of his hearers who understood
English&mdash;all the younger people and many
of the others&mdash;made sorrowful gestures. Some
of them uttered a peculiar wailing sound.</p>

<p>"It will be now our duty to find who has
put those pictures where they are, and give them
back to the person who placed them."</p>

<p>Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, the
Indian turned to Francisco.</p>

<p>"Have you loaned the key to someone this
week?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No, uncle," replied the boy, "I have not
given it to anyone; but somebody has come in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
through the window: one day I found it open."
So saying, he glanced toward the door where
some white persons were seated.</p>

<p>At this point a woman arose and stepped
about midway up the aisle.</p>

<p>"The missionary lady," whispered Walter to
his father. "Now there will be a fuss."</p>

<p>"I wish to state," said the woman, in tones
that could be distinctly heard all through the
church, "I wish to state that <i>I</i> placed those
<i>beautiful</i> pictures where they are. I intended
to offer them to the person whom they call 'the
priest,' hoping that he would hang them for the
benefit of the congregation, wherever he pleased.
Hearing he was absent, I took the liberty of
entering, and pinning them above the crosses,
which <i>I</i> consider superstitious emblems."</p>

<p>"Francisco," said the tall Indian, "remove
from the wall those pictures, and give them to
the lady.</p>

<p>"Pedro," he continued, addressing a boy close
by, "you take down on one side, so that it will be
quicker."</p>

<p>"But, my good man," began the missionary,
"if you do not wish to let them stay where they
are, at least keep them and hang them where
you will."</p>

<p>"We thank you, madam, for your kindness,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
said the Indian, "but we do not, as I said, need
them. We have already our own."</p>

<p>Francisco and Pedro with lightning celerity
had already removed the unwelcome prints and
were offering them to the would-be donor.
Reluctantly receiving them, she went slowly
back to her seat, near the door, followed by
glances from the Indians which would have
alarmed Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>When the congregation dispersed, the members
found the missionary awaiting them at the
threshold. She proffered them the pictures as
they came out, but the Indians rejected them.
Some looked at her stolidly and passed on as
though they did not see her; others merely
shook their heads, but not one accepted a picture.
Mr. Page, with his children, had stopped
near the entrance, wishing to speak to Francisco's
uncle.</p>

<p>"Tell me, sir," said the "missionary lady,"
"why these people refuse the prints I have offered
them? They should, it seems to me, be very
grateful, instead of rejecting them in so surly
a manner. I confess they are a mystery to me."</p>

<p>"Probably they were not pleased with your
methods," replied Mr. Page, coldly. "You never
see Catholics forcing their beliefs or customs on
Protestants in this manner."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>"I forgot, sir, that you were likely to be one
of them," replied the amiable missionary, darting
a glance of displeasure at Walter, who stood
beside his father. The incident ended her missionary
labors in the village of the Cupe&#241;os.
Thenceforward she transferred her efforts to
other fields, farther from home. But the consequences
were more far-reaching than anyone
could have foreseen.</p>

<p>Mr. Page waited until Francisco came out,
followed by his uncle.</p>

<p>"This is my uncle," said the boy. "These
are good Catholics," he continued, pointing to
the group.</p>

<p>The Indian extended his hand.</p>

<p>"I came to-day a little late," he said, "but
not <i>too</i> late, I think, to make one more person
see that we do not want their tracts or their
pictures or their preachings. They may do what
they will, but we are Catholics to the end&mdash;except,
perhaps, some few who find later they
would have been better off to remain as they
were. Did any of our people take pictures?"</p>

<p>"Not one," said Mr. Page. "It was quite
interesting to see how utterly they ignored
them."</p>

<p>"That is good," murmured Mauricio. "That
finished it."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"I wanted to ask," said Mr. Page, while the
children strolled slowly away together, "why
they say the Rosary in that way, reversing the
prayers at every other decade, and why they
finish it in a chant. It is very odd, but exceedingly
beautiful."</p>

<p>"I believe they change the prayers as they
do because in the beginning the Fathers found
it helped them in teaching the 'Hail, Mary,'
and 'Holy Mary,' You see, when the Father
said always the '<i>Dios te salve</i>,' or, the 'Hail,
Mary,' as you call it, the people did not learn it
so well as when they said it themselves. And
for the chanting&mdash;that was like a hymn at the
end."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Page. "And I think you
did exactly as you should have done with regard
to that officious woman. I am glad to have my
children know your nephew. He is a good boy,
and very bright. You ought to be proud of
him."</p>

<p>"So far he is very good," rejoined Mauricio.
"He is also very smart for one who has not
been long at school. We have some land here;
together we make a living, with what we get
from the visitors. One of those houses over
there belongs to me. In the summer I lease it;
in the winter we go back to it again. But this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
will end soon. There is no more hope for us;
we must go."</p>

<p>"It seems to be inevitable," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"It is sad for all of us, but worse for the
old people. Some of them will not believe it.
Some of them say they will not go, but will
lie down and die on the roadside. It is very sad.
Next week there is to be a <i>Junta</i>. But what
good will that do?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean by a <i>Junta</i>?" inquired
Mr. Page, who was not familiar with Spanish.</p>

<p>"A meeting of the Indians and the white
men who have been appointed to find another
place for us. But I can not see what good it
will do."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the Indians can then say what place
they would prefer."</p>

<p>"That, they will never say, I am sure," said
Mauricio. "They want no home but this."</p>

<p>Three or four boys now appeared above the
slope of the hill. William, in the lead, had a
gun in his hand.</p>

<p>"We've been driving rabbits," he said as they
passed. "Some day we'll have better luck&mdash;and
it won't be long, either&mdash;driving the Indians
away from Warner's."</p>

<p>"You are a very rude boy," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"I'm not an old <i>Catholic</i>," sneered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
urchin, filliping a small stone directly at Mauricio,
who made a step forward.</p>

<p>"We have a <i>cuartel</i><a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> here, youngster," he
said. "For a long time it has been empty; we
are a peaceful people. But we can have unruly
persons put into that <i>cuartel</i> if we wish. Be
careful, youngster; be careful."</p>

<p>The threat seemed to be effectual. The boys
hurried down the hill. Bidding Mauricio and
Francisco good-day, Mr. Page and his children
walked slowly homeward.</p>

<p>The Pages had noticed a good-looking Indian
boy, perhaps eighteen or nineteen years of age,
riding about on a fine horse. He wore a dark
blue uniform trimmed with red; his hat was of
good Mexican straw; he wore also a stiff white
shirt-collar. This boy seemed to live on horseback.
He was always alone. Either he held
aloof from the others, or they did not care for
his company.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>"Who is that?" asked Walter of Francisco
one morning as they were arranging the water-barrel
under the pepper tree.</p>

<p>Francisco looked around.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is Arturo, the son of Juan Pablo,"
he said.</p>

<p>"And who is Juan Pablo?"</p>

<p>"The rich man of Cupa," answered Francisco.
"He owns many houses here. He married
the daughter of the old Captain."</p>

<p>"What Captain?"</p>

<p>"That is how we call the chief," said Francisco.
"Juan Pablo is not a Cupa Indian, but
he has lived here since he was a child. Arturo
is his son."</p>

<p>"And that is why he is better dressed than the
others, and goes riding about by himself?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. Formerly he was not deemed any
better than others&mdash;nor was he different. That
is the uniform of Carlisle he wears. He goes
to school now at Carlisle."</p>

<p>"Do you mean Carlisle, Pennsylvania?" asked
Mr. Page, who had been listening to the conversation
from where he sat reading under the
<i>ramada</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes; he was one of those who went to the
schoolhouse on the hill. The teacher thought
he was a very smart boy, and she talked and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
talked with his father to let him go to the
Indian school at Carlisle. He comes home during
the vacation, and is too fine for the others.
At least, that is what they say. I have found
him well enough. I think it is the others who
imagine he is different."</p>

<p>"What will he do when his schooldays are
over?" inquired Mr. Page.</p>

<p>Francisco shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"That I can not tell," he said. "There was
Adriana. She, too, went to Carlisle. She had
only her mother. When she came back to Cupa
she was unhappy. She could not bear the life
here after having bathtubs lined with white
porcelain at Carlisle."</p>

<p>Mr. Page laughed.</p>

<p>"Is that what she said?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; that and many other things. Two
years she was at Carlisle without coming back.
Her mother was very poor&mdash;living in a brush-house
that summer, as always, renting her own
adobe for the season that she might have something
for the winter. Adriana cried all the
time. The next year she did not come back, nor
the next. When it was time for school to be
over, she wrote that she would stay in Philadelphia.
Then her mother died&mdash;of sorrow."</p>

<p>"And what became of Adriana?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"Who can tell that? No one knows. She
has not written."</p>

<p>"Are there any others?" asked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Well, there is Dionysio, who will fetch you
the wood to-day. He can tell you what he thinks
of the Indian school at Carlisle."</p>

<p>Mr. Page had become interested, Walter and
Nellie equally so. When the wood arrived they
found the driver of the wagon an intelligent-looking
youth about the age of Arturo, perhaps
a little older.</p>

<p>"They tell me you have been a student at
Carlisle," said Mr. Page after he had paid him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I spent four years there," replied
the boy, very politely.</p>

<p>"Of what benefit has it been to you?" inquired
Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"No benefit, that I can see," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Has it made you discontented?"</p>

<p>"At first&mdash;yes; but not now. I am satisfied."</p>

<p>"What do you do for your living?"</p>

<p>"What they all do."</p>

<p>"Laboring work, you mean?"</p>

<p>"Laboring work&mdash;harvesting, ploughing,
grape picking&mdash;any thing that I can do."</p>

<p>"What advantage, then, is your having been
at Carlisle?"</p>

<p>"None. There they teach us many things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
but seldom can an Indian get work in the large
cities. A white man is always given the first
chance; that is natural. I learned wood-carving.
Perhaps if I went far away and waited
long I might have been able to work at my
trade; but my old grandfather and grandmother
were alone here with my little sister. How
could I stay away from them? So here I am,
and here I will stay. It is my home; I like it
best."</p>

<p>"It is well that you look at it in that way if
it must be so. It appears to me there are hundreds
of thousands uselessly spent in the Indian
schools every year."</p>

<p>"That is very true," said the young man.
"How much better to have them on the reservations,
where are all the people together, where
all could help each other and learn from each
other. What a fertile soil is this, for instance.
How much could be done here! There are many
places like this. But now&mdash;it is a bad job, a
very bad job."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Mr. Page. "It is a
<i>very</i> bad job."</p>

<p>"I tell you," said the boy, "there are three
kinds of Indians who come from those schools.
One is ashamed of his people and will not live
with them any longer. There is not much for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
him to do anywhere, so he rambles about from
place to place. The whites despise him; for his
own people he has lost all his good heart. He
dies after awhile, always a sot and a thief.
There is another kind of Indian. He is discontented
because he has been out in the world
that does not want him. He comes back and
remains with his people; but what he has seen
and done when away makes him not content
with his home. Always there is sorrow in his
heart while he lives. If they had not taken him
away from his home he would have remained
content. Do I not say right&mdash;according to your
belief?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Page, "you do."</p>

<p>"And there is still another kind&mdash;the lazy
one who comes home and sneers at everything,
and yet is too lazy to go away and look for
something better. Pretty soon he gets lower
than those at whom he laughs and sneers. He
lives on the labor of his women&mdash;his mother,
a sister, or wife, when he gets one&mdash;until he
dies. You cannot change the Indian; if you
attempt it you spoil him."</p>

<p>Mr. Page was surprised at the extraordinary
good sense of the young man.</p>

<p>"You have a wise head on your shoulders,"
he said. "I do not wonder that with very good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
intentions, perhaps, they selected you for Carlisle.
At any rate, they have taught you to
reason."</p>

<p>"To reason!" echoed Dionysio, with a flash
of the eye and contemptuous curl of the lip
that betrayed the latent deep Indian nature.
"The Indian could reason long before he ever
saw the face of the white man&mdash;and can do it
to-day better than his teachers. I am not very
old, but that much I have seen and I know."</p>

<p>"I believe you are right again," said Mr.
Page. "I should like to talk with you some
other time."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Dionysio. "It will also
give me pleasure."</p>

<p>That evening the children took a walk with
their father and mother in search of eggs. They
were directed to a dilapidated brush-house at
some distance from their camping place. It
was said the eggs there were particularly large
and fresh. They could not find it at first and
went considerably out of their way. At length
they came to the place, the most forlorn-looking
dwelling they had yet seen. It was quite extensive,
however, open on three sides, and with
a hole in the roof for ascending smoke from a
bare fireplace. Two heaps of ragged and dirty
bed-clothing lay close to the smouldering coals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
A little farther away, almost out of sight, was
a cot. An old man lay on one heap of rags, an
old woman crouched near the fire. A little girl,
very pretty but very dirty, with beautiful large
brown eyes and long black hair, sat near the
old woman, still as a statue. They all seemed
to be asleep.</p>

<p>"Have you any eggs to sell?" asked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>The old woman rose from the ground. She
was crippled, and appeared bent nearly double.
She called her husband, who with great labor
also got up from his heap of rags. The child,
seeing the bucket in Walter's hand, cried out in
Spanish:</p>

<p>"<i>Huevos, huevos!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> The old people screamed
at each other in a <i>patois</i> of Spanish and Indian,
principally the latter. Then the child, in obedience
to some words from the grandmother,
asked, "How many?" "A couple of dozen," was
the reply. The little one disappeared into the
darkness in the rear of the dwelling, faintly
illumined by the dying fire.</p>

<p>She presently issued forth, carrying the eggs
in her apron. She counted them into the pail,
and Mr. Page placed a quarter in her hand.
The old woman snatched it eagerly from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
child and thrust it into a bag which she took
from her bosom. Nothing could have been more
squalid or uncomfortable than the hut, nothing
more unlovely than the inhabitants with the
exception of the child, whose beauty and innocence
neither dirt nor squalor could destroy.</p>

<p>The old man began to busy himself with the
fire, throwing some brush upon it, while his wife
produced a blackened coffee-pot from one corner
and put it on the coals. They gave no more
attention to their visitors than as if they did
not exist.</p>

<p>"One would think they did not know we were
here," said Walter.</p>

<p>"Probably they mean that we should go,"
suggested his father. "Now that we have the
eggs there is no excuse for our staying."</p>

<p>"I wish we could have that cute little thing
to live with us," said Nellie. "She is not so
very dark. I would like her for a little playmate,
mamma."</p>

<p>"She is very attractive," said her mother.
"What a pity she must live in a hovel like this."
They turned to go, when a young man entered
from the outside. It was Dionysio.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," he replied to Mr. Page's
salutation. "Were you looking for me?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Page, "we were not looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
for you, but we are glad to see you. We
have been purchasing eggs from these old people.
I am told they have an excellent lot of fowls.
Perhaps you are on the same errand."</p>

<p>"I!" exclaimed the boy; "I live here&mdash;these
are my grandfather and grandmother&mdash;and my
little sister," he added, as the child glided to
his side.</p>

<p>Mrs. Page regarded him sadly.</p>

<p>"You are thinking, madam," said the Indian
boy, "that it is a poor place&mdash;and so it is. But
in the winter we are a little better off. Ours is
yonder adobe house. My grandparents are too
old and my sister too little to do much work.
I must be away working whenever I can."</p>

<p>"What is your sister's name?" inquired Mrs.
Page. "She is a lovely child."</p>

<p>"She is called Margarita," said the boy. "She
is fond of her brother."</p>

<p>"Mamma," whispered Nellie, "ask him to let
her come and play with me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Page did not reply. The child was in
her present condition not a possible companion
for her own.</p>

<p>Dionysio had heard the whisper, and instantly
divining what was in the mind of Mrs.
Page, he said:</p>

<p>"You see that she is neglected; but what can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
I do? My grandmother is very queer. She will
not allow the little one to go to the school on
the hill because the teacher is not Catholic, and
she will not send her to the Mission for then
Margarita will be away so far. She does not
let her from her side. What can I do?"</p>

<p>"That is true; you can do nothing," said
Mrs. Page. "But perhaps some day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, when they die&mdash;the old people, you
mean," continued Dionysio in the most matter-of-fact
tone. "Then I shall send her to the Mission.
But while they live it must be as they
say. I hope you will like the eggs; we have
them always very good."</p>

<p>He made way for them to pass, a courteous
smile upon his lips, his little sister clinging to
his hand.</p>

<p>A few days after this, when Alfonsa, the old
woman who had said prayers in the church, and
who had since undertaken to do the family
washing, came for the clothes she said:</p>

<p>"There has been a death in the night. The
grandmother of Dionysio is gone. She was
eighty-five. But many have lived longer. The
grandfather is ninety."</p>

<p>"How good of that boy to be so kind and
work so hard for them," remarked Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"They are not so poor, maybe," rejoined Alfonsa.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
"With a vineyard and a little ranch,
and the old woman always with chickens and
eggs&mdash;they are not so poor, maybe."</p>

<p>"What will become of the little one?" inquired
Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"Who can tell? Some one will take her.
Dionysio can stay with the old man."</p>

<p>"Couldn't <i>we</i> have her, mother?" asked
Nellie. "She is so sweet."</p>

<p>"What would you do with her, child?" inquired
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"Love her and have her for a little playmate,"
said Nellie.</p>

<p>"Well, well! Who ever heard the like!" exclaimed
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"But she is <i>so</i> sweet," repeated Nellie. "Let
us have her, mother."</p>

<p>Alfonsa smiled at Nellie and went off with
the clothes.</p>

<p>Nellie still persisted in her pleading. Mr.
Page was reading within hearing distance. He
now looked up from his paper and said to his
wife:</p>

<p>"Martha, since we came to California you
have not had an orphan to care for. Before
that there were always one or two."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so," agreed his wife. "Some
one would die, or some waif would come along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
and we would keep them till a home was provided."</p>

<p>"Suppose you take the little Indian," said
her husband. "I am greatly interested in the
boy. He and I have a chat nearly every day.
We might be able to give <i>him</i> some kind of a
chance also. If I buy that ranch up at Poway
he could be of use there."</p>

<p>"What do you wish me to do&mdash;not to take
the child into the family as one of us, surely?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not exactly; but we could take her
in now, and later send her to the Mission, or
perhaps to school in town. If she is anything
like her brother she will become a help to you
some day."</p>

<p>Nellie listened with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, do, mamma; do, do!" she begged.</p>

<p>"Well, I am willing to try it," said the
mother. "That is, if her brother consents, and
we can get her thoroughly washed and combed
and clothed before we bring her here. How is
that to be done?"</p>

<p>"Alfonsa will do it," cried Nellie. "She has
the <i>cleanest</i> house, mother&mdash;the <i>cleanest</i>&mdash;and
you see how neat she looks."</p>

<p>"Well, we can ask her after we have seen
Dionysio," said her mother.</p>

<p>It was trying for Nellie to wait until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
laid the old woman away on the hillside, where
the Indians bury their dead.</p>

<p>Alfonsa was first approached with regard to
the child. "Yes," she said, she would take the
little one gladly; "and scrub and comb her
every day for a week till she is clean enough
to bring under the roof of the good, kind lady."</p>

<p>"But will the brother give her to us?" asked
Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"If he is wise, he will," said Alfonsa. "And
he has always been wise."</p>

<p>Dionysio was pleased. His eyes brightened
when the subject was broached to him.</p>

<p>"But she is not clean," he said. "I could not
bring her to you as she is."</p>

<p>The talk with Alfonsa was then repeated.
Dionysio had no objection to make, and Margarita
herself was willing. A week of "quarantine,"
as Mr. Page humorously referred to
it, and one morning Dionysio made his appearance,
leading his sister by the hand. She wore
a clean blue calico dress, and a red ribbon in
her neatly braided hair. Her face was radiant,
and when Mrs. Page approached, she at once
went forward and placed one little brown hand
in hers.</p>

<p>"I have never seen her do like that," said the
boy. "She is so shy."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"I have come to live with you," said the
child, gazing frankly around the tent till her
glance included every member of the family.</p>

<p>"And you are welcome, my dear," said Aunt
Mary, disarmed of her reserve and prejudice,
much to the surprise of everybody. She said
afterward that no one could have resisted such
a charming face and manner. From that moment
her subjugation was complete, and Margarita
attached herself with equal affection to
the kindly, if peculiar, old aunt. In a few days
the child had adapted herself to all the ways of
her new friends. Her amiable disposition and
willingness to wait upon everybody soon endeared
her to all the family. Nellie petted and
caressed her&mdash;it did not seem to spoil her. She
slept on a rug in the larger tent, wrapped in a
blanket, and curled up like a kitten. It was
as though the little orphan had always lived
among them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="small">THE PEDLAR.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>"Comalong! Alcomout!"</p>

<p>"Comalong! Alcomout!"</p>

<p>Loud and shrill came the nasal tones accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
by the sharp ringing of a little bell. The
children rushed from the tent. It was just after
breakfast.</p>

<p>A square, black-covered wagon, with a very
high seat, on which was perched an odd-looking
little man with grizled, curling hair, had stopped
outside.</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it was an Indian!" exclaimed
Walter. "You're not an Indian, are you?"</p>

<p>"Think not," replied the little man, pleasantly
but tersely. "I'm a Portugee&mdash;a long
time away from my own country. Why you
think me an Indian, young man?"</p>

<p>"That foreign language you speak," replied
Walter. "I thought it was Indian."</p>

<p>"'Foreign language?'" said the man, laughing
merrily. "That's English."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"Comalong&mdash;alcomout. I've said it so often
I guess it don't sound just right; but I'll do it
better for you, so you can understand it. I'll
say it slow: Come&mdash;along&mdash;all&mdash;come&mdash;out.
Do you know what it is now?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; that's easy enough," said Walter.
"What have you got in your wagon?"</p>

<p>"Everything&mdash;calico, muslin, flannel, shoes,
stockings, shirts, pots, pans, perfume, ribbons,
laces&mdash;everything."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>He had descended from his perch, and was
opening the door of his wagon. It was very
neatly arranged inside. The various articles of
merchandise were placed separate and in order.
With great good nature, the man began exhibiting
his wares.</p>

<p>"Here," he said, taking a couple of calico
dresses from a box in which they had been
neatly folded, "here are two pretty frocks, if
you have a little girl. I'll sell 'em cheap. You
see they're not the latest style, so we can't very
well dispose of them in this fashionable part of
the world."</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Aunt Mary. "We may
not be so particular. We have a little girl here
whom they may fit. Come, 'Rita; let us see."</p>

<p>The child came at her bidding, looking
eagerly into the pasteboard box.</p>

<p>"Ho, hello!" said the pedlar, in surprise.
"What have we here? Isn't this the little girl
of the Barco's? Isn't this Dionysio's sister?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Walter. "She lives with us
now. Her grandmother is dead."</p>

<p>"Are you going to keep her?"</p>

<p>"For a while at least," replied Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"That is good&mdash;for her, very good," said the
pedlar, slowly. Then he added: "That child is
a relation of my wife's."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Is your wife an Indian?" asked Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; she is an Indian&mdash;and a very good
Indian. Pretty, too, like the little girl. I
would have taken the child&mdash;Dionysio knows
it."</p>

<p>"Have you no children of your own?" asked
Aunt Mary.</p>

<p>"No; but we would be very good to this one.
Perhaps you will not like to keep her always."</p>

<p>"I can not say. For the present she remains
with us."</p>

<p>'Rita had climbed up on the wagon wheel,
and was pulling the boxes about.</p>

<p>"She knows where to look for the candy," said
the pedlar, producing a box of gum-drops.</p>

<p>The two little dresses were purchased by Aunt
Mary, as well as some other small articles for
the child's use. A pair of shoes and some stockings
were included.</p>

<p>"You will find it hard to get her to wear
shoes," said the pedlar. "She has never had a
pair on her feet."</p>

<p>"I will try to get a pair that is quite large,"
said Aunt Mary. "She must become used to
them gradually, of course."</p>

<p>When all the purchases had been made, the
pedlar said:</p>

<p>"I'll be around here again in a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
days; if you need anything else, you can get
it. I camp up there above the springs."</p>

<p>"Do you sleep in your tent?" asked Walter.</p>

<p>"When it is cold I sleep in the wagon; when
it is warm I have my cot. See?"</p>

<p>Looking underneath the wagon they saw a cot
strapped to the outer floor. A number of cooking
utensils hung from various hooks. There
was also a camp stove and portable oven&mdash;everything
necessary for comfort.</p>

<p>"When I strike a place like this where there
is a restaurant I don't cook for myself, but often
I am miles from a settlement when night comes.
Then I <i>must</i> cook for myself or starve."</p>

<p>He prepared to depart, but before he went on
his way he raised Margarita in his arms and
whispered something in her ear.</p>

<p>"No," replied the child, shaking her head.</p>

<p>"<i>Dulces?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> he said, pointing to the box of
candy.</p>

<p>"No," she said, "<i>muchas aqui</i>."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>

<p>Aunt Mary did not like his actions. "What
did he say?" she inquired, but Margarita had
not yet sufficient knowledge of English to explain.</p>

<p>The new dresses were tried on; they fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
very well, and the child was delighted. When
Dionysio came they told him about the pedlar.</p>

<p>"I saw him just now," he said. "He was
scolding me because I would not give 'Rita to
him. He says my grandmother promised, but
I do not believe it. If so, she did not know what
she was saying. Anyhow, she had not the
right."</p>

<p>"He says you are cousins of his wife," said
Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but what is that? All are cousins
here. His wife is not a good woman; she is
drunk many times, though he is well enough
himself. He thinks if she had the child, his
wife would be better, but I do not believe it."</p>

<p>Margarita had been listening attentively.
She went up to her brother, put her hand in his
and said in Spanish:</p>

<p>"Hernando told me he would give me pretty
clothes if I would go home with him, and I said
the lady had given me some. He said I could
every day have candy, but I told him we had
plenty here. I do not want to go with Hernando."</p>

<p>"And you shall not go, Margarita," promised
her brother. "You shall not go."</p>

<p>All that day the pedlar's bell could be heard
through the valley; the children met him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
their rambles several times, but he did not come
to their camp again.</p>

<p>The following morning, as they were preparing
to go with Francisco for water, he passed them.</p>

<p>"Are you going away for good now?" inquired
Walter.</p>

<p>"Yes, until fall at least," said the pedlar. "I
have sold nearly all my things. I am off to
San Jacinto for more."</p>

<p>His horses trotted off briskly, and the team
was soon out of sight. According to their usual
custom the children remained some time at the
cold spring. Nellie and 'Rita strolled from place
to place, looking for "sour-grass"; the boys lay
in the shade of one of the large trees.</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" shouted Francisco, after they had
been there quite a while. "It is time."</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" repeated a mocking voice. "It is
time."</p>

<p>"That's William again," said Francisco. "We
have not seen him for long, but now he is here."</p>

<p>There was a crashing through the bushes, and
the form of their enemy appeared. He was
whirling a dead rattlesnake on the point of a
stick. Much to their surprise, he neither paused
nor sought to molest them. Apparently he was
in a hurry to get away.</p>

<p>They were greatly alarmed the next moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
at sight of Nellie running toward them. Her
hat was off, her braids were unfastened, and she
was panting for breath.</p>

<p>"What is wrong? What is the matter?" cried
Walter and Francisco together.</p>

<p>"I can not find 'Rita," she replied, and burst
into tears. "We were looking for sour-grass,
and she went a little distance off. All at once
that horrid boy came with a dead snake. He
began to run after me. I ran ever so far, and
at last he stopped. I begged and begged him
not to throw it on me, and I cried. Then, when
he went away, I called 'Rita because I could not
see her. She did not answer. I went back to
the place where she had been. She wasn't there.
And I can't find her at all."</p>

<p>"But you were not far?" inquired Francisco.
"She could not get lost so soon. Walter and
I will find her in a minute. Sit there and rest."</p>

<p>The two boys were soon traversing the broad,
grassy plateau. It was so bare of trees that no
one could possibly be roaming over it without
being seen. 'Rita was not there. Francisco
called to her Indian fashion, but his calls were
not answered.</p>

<p>"Come up, Nellie," said Walter, at last, running
down again to the edge of the bank where
they had left his sister. "Come and show us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
where you last saw her. We can't find her nor
make her hear."</p>

<p>The little girl was soon beside them.</p>

<p>"Just over there," she said, "not far from
those bushes. She must have gone into them
and got lost. I ran in the other direction when
William came after me with the snake. Let's
go down into the bushes and look for her. What
is there on the other side, Francisco?"</p>

<p>"All bushes, thicker and thicker till you come
to the road," said the Indian boy. "On the
other side of the road there are more bushes,
and after them a broad meadow like this."</p>

<p>"She couldn't get through them," said Walter.
"They are so very close together and she is so
timid&mdash;she would not try it."</p>

<p>Francisco inclined his head on one side and
listened.</p>

<p>"Do you hear the horse's whinny?" he asked.
"I have heard it three times since we came up
here."</p>

<p>"No," replied the brother and sister. They
had not heard any such sound.</p>

<p>"I have a thought," said the Indian boy. "I
will go quietly through the bushes. There is
no need for all of us. When I come back you
may come along if you like. Just a stick for
the snakes, and then I go."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>Seizing a branch that lay at the foot of a tree,
Francisco started to push his way through the
thicket.</p>

<p>"Where do you suppose he has gone?" asked
Nellie.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Walter; "but Francisco
is all right. He knows what he's about."</p>

<p>After a little while the Indian boy reappeared
looking elated.</p>

<p>"I did not make a mistake," he said. "It is
Hernando who has taken Margarita. There
she sits on his lap by the wagon. He has
stopped there to water the horses. Come; I will
show you."</p>

<p>"Do you think he means to steal her, Francisco?
Oh, do you think he wants to take her
away?" asked Nellie, tearfully.</p>

<p>"That I cannot tell," said Francisco. "He
will not dare, when he sees us."</p>

<p>"How can we stop him? He can run off with
his horses. Oh, how dreadful! how dreadful!"
said Nellie, all but crying.</p>

<p>"Now, sister, if you are going to cry, we'll
have to leave you behind," said Walter, keen for
an adventure. He stepped softly on tiptoe in
the tracks of Francisco as he had seen other boys
do in pictures.</p>

<p>"But I won't stay behind," answered Nellie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
stifling a sob. "Mamma would not like it if
you left me here."</p>

<p>"We will not leave you; come along," said
Francisco, leading across the meadow to another
fringe of bushes. "Only be quiet," he continued,
"so we will not be seen." They skirted the
thicket, going a long way round, and after a
time crossed the road and came out on a broad
green expanse.</p>

<p>Two horses were feeding in the open; a wagon
stood close by. The pedlar, his back to the children,
was smoking under a tree. Beside him,
contentedly munching candy from a box in her
lap, sat Margarita.</p>

<p>"Ay! ay! 'Rita!" cried Francisco, coming
suddenly upon them, "why did you run away?"</p>

<p>The child looked at the pedlar, who was visibly
perturbed. "I found her over there alone,"
he explained to Francisco, "so I brought her
here. I would have taken her back in the wagon,
though it would have lost me time. I was going
when I had finished my pipe."</p>

<p>The child looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"And not to go to Veronica?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why to Veronica? Of course not," he replied
quickly.</p>

<p>"But you said&mdash;&mdash;" began the child.</p>

<p>"It does not matter what he said," interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Francisco. "Come, now; we must go
home. I believe you are a rogue, Hernando,"
he continued turning to the pedlar. "I believe
you are a great rogue&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Hernando laughed. "Well, if I am," he said,
"I am not the only one in the world. You cannot
prove anything of that which you are thinking."</p>

<p>"If you were not guilty, Hernando," answered
Francisco, "you would not so quickly
understand my meaning."</p>

<p>The man rose to his feet and busied himself
with the ponies.</p>

<p>"Well, go now, and let that be all," he said.
"Take along with you the candy, Margarita."</p>

<p>Francisco lifted the child onto his shoulder.
"I will carry you some," he said. "Did you
want to go away from Nellie and Walter?" he
asked in Spanish.</p>

<p>"No, only till next week," she replied. "Hernando
said that there in his home were pretty
dolls&mdash;oh, such pretty dolls that Veronica had
for me&mdash;and many bright rings. He said that
Dionysio had told him to take me there."</p>

<p>"But, 'Rita, do you not know that the other
day Dionysio said you should never go to Veronica."</p>

<p>"Yes; but perhaps to-day it was different, I
thought."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"He would perhaps never have brought you
back. You must promise not again to go away
with anybody."</p>

<p>"He carried me."</p>

<p>"Oh, well, I believe he meant to steal you.
Veronica would have beaten you, 'Rita."</p>

<p>"I am glad not to have gone with him," said
the child. "Let me walk now."</p>

<p>He set her down, and taking Nellie by the
hand she clung to her all the way home.</p>

<p>As they passed the cottage where the missionary
resided they saw a crowd near the door.</p>

<p>"It is what they call a prayer-meeting, I
think," said the Indian boy.</p>

<p>"Not at this time of day," remarked Walter.
"The missionary woman is crying."</p>

<p>"Maybe William frightened her with the rattlesnake,"
said Francisco.</p>

<p>"But your uncle is there&mdash;I see him," said
Nellie. "He is talking to the men."</p>

<p>"Very well; but it is late now, and we must
not stop," said Francisco. "Perhaps she has
been putting some pictures in the church again.
My uncle can get angry, too, sometimes."</p>

<p>"But he would not make a woman cry, would
he, Francisco?" asked Nellie, with some anxiety.</p>

<p>"No; I do not think he would make a woman
cry. It is strange, a little, that he is there;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
but he would be displeased if I should go over
and leave the water on the roadside. Your people
will be wondering why we are not back."</p>

<p>At the camp they had begun to feel uneasy.
When everything had been explained by the children,
who now that Margarita was safe rather
enjoyed telling the experience, the elders were
inclined to think Hernando really intended to
kidnap the child.</p>

<p>"That is what I think," said Francisco.
"When he went away to-day he was not thinking
of it, maybe, but when he saw her from his
high seat in the wagon he thought he would
take her home with him. He has not much good
sense, that fellow. If she had cried on the road
he would, maybe, have brought her back. Anyhow,
there is not much harm done&mdash;maybe good&mdash;for
she will be careful now."</p>

<p>He was in the act of turning Rosinante homeward
when he saw his uncle approaching. The
old man looked very much troubled.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"Something very bad," was the reply.
"Something very, very bad. I do not believe
it, Francisco, but the missionary woman has lost
her pocket-book, and they say that you have
stolen it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="small">FALSELY ACCUSED.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Francisco paled visibly under his swarthy
skin. Then his face grew a dark crimson.</p>

<p>"They think I have stolen it!" he exclaimed.
"I have never been in the house of that woman.
No one can say that they have ever seen me
there."</p>

<p>"So I told them. But there is someone there
who saw you yesterday near the <i>ramada</i><a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> next
door," said Mauricio.</p>

<p>"What of that, uncle? Do I not go every
other day with water to the people who live
there? And is not the water kept under the
<i>ramada</i>?"</p>

<p>"Very true. But there is much loud talking
down there. She threatens to have you arrested."</p>

<p>"But you are the constable. You will not
put me in the <i>cuartel</i>?"</p>

<p>"I must, if there is sworn out a warrant,"
replied Mauricio, sadly.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Mr. Page, "it will not
amount to that, I hope. Let us go down at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
once to the house where the money was stolen
and see what they have to say&mdash;on what grounds,
if any, they accuse you."</p>

<p>"That is the best thing to do," assented Mauricio.
"It will show that you are not afraid."</p>

<p>The children stood amazed, grieved, and
silent. Their busy minds imagined all sorts of
dire possibilities for their friend Francisco.</p>

<p>Without a word Francisco followed the two
older men, his head erect, his eyes fearless and
unashamed. People looked at them in passing,
nearly all in sympathy, for Francisco was a
favorite with all the visitors save the very
few friends of the missionary woman. The
crowd had not diminished when they reached
the house, and all eyes were turned toward them.</p>

<p>"Where is the person who has lost a pocket-book,"
inquired Mr. Page, looking from one to
another.</p>

<p>"Inside," replied a man, a cripple whom
Francisco had often assisted at the baths. "She
is quite hysterical. I hear it contained a large
sum of money. I'll never believe Francisco had
anything to do with the theft."</p>

<p>Mr. Page did not reply. The boy gave his
defender a grateful look before passing into the
house with the others.</p>

<p>The loser of the pocket-book sat in a rocking-chair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
somewhat calmer and more composed than
she had been when Mauricio left her. The sight
of Francisco, however, seemed to bring on a renewal
of her excitement until Mr. Page said:</p>

<p>"Pray be quiet, madam, until we have learned
something of the particulars of this theft. I
am here on behalf of this boy, whom, I am told,
you accuse of having taken your pocket-book.
It is a very serious accusation."</p>

<p>William, stationed back of his mother's chair,
darted a triumphant glance at the Indian boy.
Francisco stood, cap in hand, silently awaiting
what the woman had to say. With a hysterical
gulp, she began:</p>

<p>"I always keep my pocket-book with me, usually
in my bosom. Yesterday, while I was lying
in the hammock, a pedlar came with some notions.
I bought from him a paper of pins. After
paying him I put the pocket-book under the
pillow of the hammock. I distinctly remember
doing that. Afterward I dozed off, and upon
awaking forgot all about the pocket-book.
Everybody was at the baths at the time, and I
hurried there so as to get my bath before dinner.</p>

<p>"When I came back, the Indian boy was just
going off with his water-wagon. I would have
spoken to him, but he avoided me. I attributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
this to surliness at the time, but now I believe
it was because he was guilty and could not meet
my eye."</p>

<p>Francisco was about to speak, but Mr. Page
said: "Not yet, Francisco; not yet. Is this
all the evidence you have against the boy,
madam?" he continued.</p>

<p>"No, it is not," she rejoined. "I did not miss
the pocket-book until this morning. As soon as
I <i>did</i> miss it I went to the hammock. It was
not there. My neighbor first put it into my
head that the boy might have taken it."</p>

<p>"Please let me speak a word," now interrupted
a kindly-looking, gray-haired woman sitting
near the missionary. "I am Mrs. Minkson's
nearest neighbor. We have the <i>ramada</i>
in common. I want everyone in this room and
in this village to understand, first and foremost,
that I had no idea of accusing Francisco when
I said what I did. When Mrs. Minkson came
to me and told me she had lost her money, she
also asked me if I had seen anyone about the
place yesterday. I told her no, only Francisco
just as I was coming up from my bath. I saw
him stoop and pick up a blanket from the
ground and throw it on the hammock. He was
coming then with water for me. I saw him before
he reached the <i>ramada</i> and when he went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
away. I never meant that Mrs. Minkson should
think he had taken her pocket-book."</p>

<p>"May I speak now, Mr. Page?" Francisco
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; tell what took place while you were in
the neighborhood," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Yesterday I came here with water about
eleven o'clock," began the boy. "There was no
one around. I saw Mrs. Plummer coming up
from the bath-house. When I went by the hammock
a blanket was lying on the ground. So
it wouldn't be trampled on by someone nor get
wet from my barrel, I picked it up and laid it
at the foot of the hammock. I left the water
for Mrs. Plummer and went away. That is all
I know."</p>

<p>A murmur arose from the crowd, whether of
approbation or the contrary could not well be
determined. Mr. Page was too much concerned
to notice it. Francisco and his uncle also were
preoccupied.</p>

<p>"I believe your story, Francisco," said Mr.
Page. "I trust that everyone here believes it.
I can see nothing in what has been told to warrant
the accusation made."</p>

<p>"That isn't all," exclaimed William, from
behind his mother's chair. "I know something
worse than that, I do."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>"Out with it at once, my boy," said Mr. Page.
"Let us hear everything you know."</p>

<p>"Well, I didn't tell this before, but I saw
Francisco last night with a twenty-dollar gold-piece
in his hand, standing in the restaurant."</p>

<p>"William," protested his mother, sharply,
pushing him away from her, "didn't I tell you
that had nothing to do with it. There was no
gold in that pocket-book."</p>

<p>The crowd laughed, and William, nothing
daunted, went on:</p>

<p>"I think it's mighty funny when an Indian
like him can throw twenty-dollar gold-pieces
'round."</p>

<p>Francisco looked at Mr. Page; that gentleman
nodded.</p>

<p>"In order to clear the boy of any suspicion
these ill-advised and malicious remarks may
have aroused in the minds of his hearers," he
said, "I will now state that I gave Francisco
the gold-piece to have changed for me at the
restaurant."</p>

<p>A white boy in Francisco's position would
have faced his opponent with a triumphant
smile; the Indian did not even look toward
him. But he glanced gratefully at Mr. Page,
and the face of Mauricio grew less grave and
troubled than it had been.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to ask," said Mr. Page, once
more turning to the missionary, "whether you
may not have been mistaken as to where you
placed your pocket-book? Have you looked
everywhere about the house?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I have <i>not</i> been mistaken," she
replied. "I remember perfectly well having put
it under the pillow. It is very easy to go
through this house. There is not even a closet
in it. Where could it be hidden?"</p>

<p>"Have you looked under the mattress?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I have not. I never put money
under a mattress."</p>

<p>"'Tis my belief, 'tis my belief," whispered a
rheumatic old Irishman to Mr. Page, "that the
b'y yonder," pointing to William, "has got up
some thrick agin the Indian. He have a great
spite agin him."</p>

<p>"You don't believe he has hidden the money,
do you?" inquired Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"I do, ye know," was the reply. "He's the
divil's own limb&mdash;that same youngster. And
they both of them, mother and son, have a great
spite agin the Indians because they're Catholics.
'Tis a shame, sir, to have that innocent crathur
accused in this way."</p>

<p>"It is," agreed Mr. Page. "But no one who
knows him will believe it. Further, there is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
the slightest evidence to support the woman's
accusation."</p>

<p>The old man looked at him quizzically. "You
are a lawyer, I believe, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," replied Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"From your point of view you are right, sir,"
replied the old man deliberately. "There's
nothing agin him. <i>But&mdash;but</i>," he continued
with greater deliberation, laying his shriveled
hand on Mr. Page's arm, "till that b'y's cleared,
till the pocket-book's found or the real thief's
caught&mdash;there always will be a suspicion agin
him as long as he lives."</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Mr. Page. "The
matter is very unfortunate. But we are powerless
in the matter. We can do nothing."</p>

<p>The old man shook his head sadly, and was
about to leave the house when his glance rested
on the edge of the throng near the door. His
old eyes brightened. Again laying his finger on
Mr. Page's coat-sleeve, he said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"If I'm not mistaken here is someone who'll
go to the root of the matter without much more
ado. <i>He'll</i> put things through in a hurry.
<i>He'll</i> find the pocket-book or the thief, or he'll
know why."</p>

<p>Following the old man's glance, Mr. Page
saw an Indian parting the crowd. He was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
tall and well-built, and his features were somewhat
rugged. An air of authority betokened
him a person of some importance.</p>

<p>"It's the Captain," said the old man. "It's
Cecilio, the head man of them all. Wait, now,
till ye hear him."</p>

<p>The Indian stepped to Mauricio's side.</p>

<p>"As I came through the village," he said, "I
heard of the trouble." Then they talked together
in their own language. Presently Cecilio
went over to Mrs. Minkson.</p>

<p>"Madam," he said, politely in excellent English,
"they say a pocket-book has been lost here
by you, and that you suspect this boy, Francisco,
to be the thief.</p>

<p>"I am the Captain of this village, and when
we have sent away this crowd of people, or, at
least, made them stand on the outside, we will
search the house thoroughly."</p>

<p>"You have no right to search my house," said
the missionary. "It has been done already."</p>

<p>"I have a right, and I will use it," he said.
"Will you go out, please, my good friends, so
that we may not be hindered?"</p>

<p>The people, complying with his request, slowly
left the house.</p>

<p>"This is my good friend, Mr. Page," said
Francisco. "May he not stay with us here?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; that is all right," said Cecilio. "It is
better that we have a witness."</p>

<p>"Or two," said the old Irishman, coming
nearer to Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Or two," repeated Cecilio, smilingly.</p>

<p>"Now, madam, will you kindly open these
boxes and search through your clothing?" requested
the Captain.</p>

<p>"I tell you I will not do it," said Mrs. Minkson.
"This is an outrage. This is my house
while I am in it, and you dare not order me
to do anything I do not choose."</p>

<p>"Very well, madam," calmly remarked the
Indian; "then we look ourselves."</p>

<p>"You are up to some trick," said the missionary.
"The boy has probably handed it to you, and
you will pretend to find it. You shall <i>not</i> search
my house. Go out of here&mdash;go out!"</p>

<p>The two Indian men again conversed in low
tones. Then Cecilio said:</p>

<p>"It is either that you look, or that we do.
You will choose. They say that you left it in
the hammock. Will you go first to the hammock,
please?"</p>

<p>The woman saw determination in the eyes of
the Captain. Very slowly she walked to the
door and stepped to the <i>ramada</i>, in front of
which the crowd still lingered. She lifted the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
pillow and was about to replace it, protesting
loudly, "This is a farce," when it fell to the
ground, the open end of the cover facing downward.
Out of this end a brown leather pocket-book
rolled toward the feet of the spectators.</p>

<p>Quite a tumult of congratulation ensued.
Francisco soon became the centre of a sympathetic
throng. Mrs. Minkson, very much discomfited,
was not one of them. On the contrary,
she hurried into the house without a word and
closed the door.</p>

<p>Cecilio turned to the spectators and, laying
his hand on the shoulder of Francisco, said:</p>

<p>"My good friends, I see that you have not believed
this boy a thief. You have seen that the
woman, instead of putting the pocket-book under
the pillow, placed it by accident <i>in</i> the cover.
Some of you who are here know us very well.
To others we are strangers. But it is just and
right that the strangers should learn what is
very well known to all who are our friends; and
it is this:</p>

<p>"For more than twenty-five years the Hot
Springs have been visited by white people; we
have thrown open to them our houses, and we
have moved out of them, going elsewhere to live;
we have always kept away from them, staying in
our own dwellings and going our own ways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
That no one can deny. And in all those years,
in this village where no door is ever locked,
never once has an Indian been known to enter a
house where the people were not&mdash;not once has
anything been stolen by an Indian. That, my
friends, can be proved.</p>

<p>"Francisco, this boy here, is without father
and mother, but he has been always good, always
faithful, always industrious, always honest. And
to-day he has not lost his good name. Soon we
Indians must leave our homes, soon we must be
cast out of the place of our fathers; but, at
least, if it be God's will thus to chastise us, let
it not be said at the end what has never been
said of us&mdash;that we are thieves or robbers."</p>

<p>With a courteous wave of the hand, he passed
through the crowd and quickly remounted his
horse, a fine animal, on which he sat like a cavalier
of old. As he rode away there arose a cheer
from the crowd for "Captain Cecilio."</p>

<p>The people&mdash;whites and Indians&mdash;gathered
round Francisco, and nearly everybody shook his
hand. The boy received their good wishes quietly
but gratefully, with the natural dignity of
his race. After many a pause on the road he
returned to the tent with Mr. Page and Mauricio.
The good news had preceded them, and
the children shouted for joy; Walter loudly expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
his belief that the whole thing had been
a plot devised by the missionary for the ruin of
their friend. For this he was immediately reproved
by his parents for rash judgment and
want of charity, but subsided only after several
reminders.</p>

<p>Francisco reported the next day that Mrs.
Minkson had apologized to him for her suspicions,
which action showed her to be possessed
of a Christian spirit, even though mistaken zeal
had carried her out of her own province. The
boy William remained implacable to the end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="small">A JAUNT.&mdash;THE VALLEY OF THE RATTLESNAKES.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>Bleak and barren as is for the most part the
immediate neighborhood of the Springs, one
need not ride very far to reach the cool shade
of the mountain woods.</p>

<p>One day, when Walter and Nellie were telling
Francisco of the delicious sugar-cane in their
native State and lamenting that in California
there were no lilacs or "snowballs," the Indian
boy said:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>

<p>"But yes; in the garden of the teacher there
are always lilacs in the spring. From the woods
the children brought them to her, young plants;
now they are trees, and they bloom very well
indeed. She says they are not so large or so
sweet-swelling as those of her own home in the
East, but yet they will do, she says. And of
snowball trees she has two."</p>

<p>"With bright green leaves and big, round
flowers, like snowballs?" asked Nellie.</p>

<p>"Yes, from a distance that is how they look.
Now they have done blooming, but in the spring
they are fine. Wild roses we have in the woods
over yonder. There are spots full of them.
Would you like to see? And I will show you
then the sugar tree."</p>

<p>"Let us ask papa to have a picnic. Can we
come and go in one day, Francisco?"</p>

<p>"Easily, if we start early enough," said Francisco.</p>

<p>The children lost no time in making their request.
Everybody was willing to do something
to vary the monotony of life in Cupa. Very
early one morning a few days later the party,
with Mauricio and Francisco in charge, started
for the woods.</p>

<p>Mr. Page was something of a naturalist, or,
it might more properly be said, a lover of nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
in every beautiful form. When they had come
into the shadow of the woods he began to observe
the various kinds of shrubs, and was
pleased to find a variety of "buckeye" native
to California. Presently they came upon a large
cluster of bushes, growing luxuriantly, the leaves
of which very much resembled those of the
india-rubber tree.</p>

<p>"There," said Francisco, "is a tree the Americans
call 'mahogany tree' on account of its color,
but the Indians name it <i>limonada</i>."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"The lemonade tree," said Mauricio. "The
little fruits, or pods, have a sour sweetness. We
soak them in water, and they make a nice lemonade.
You will see our women and children
gathering them when they are getting ripe.
They put them into sacks and carry them home.
Then they lay them in the sun to dry. It is
a very nice drink. We have some at our house.
Some day, if you wish, Francisco will take you
a quantity."</p>

<p>"Yes; we'd like to taste it," said Nellie.
"Perhaps we might gather some of the fruit
and take it home."</p>

<p>"Of what need?" said the Indian boy.
"There you have plenty lemons. Here we have
none&mdash;that is, unless we buy them."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>"They are cheaper now than in the old days,"
said Mauricio. "Still, many of our people like
better the <i>limonada</i> pods."</p>

<p>"Over there, in the ca&#241;on," said Francisco,
"are the sugar trees. It is not the time now
for the fruit, but later in the autumn they will
gather it and dry it."</p>

<p>They followed a well-worn road along the
course of a small stream which trickled down the
mountain-side&mdash;now disappearing, now shining
like a thread of silver, now crossing the path
in front of them. All along the road, marking
its course in its curving deviations, grew the
beautiful wax myrtle, with its smooth, dark-green
leaves and perfect, white flowers.</p>

<p>As they plunged deeper into the woods, the
rich, pungent odor of the mountain sage grew
more pronounced; they came upon wild bees
flitting from flower to flower. Clumps of wild-rose
trees, drooping with blooms, offered a generous
hospitality to the industrious gatherers of
honey. However, the little wayfarers undoubtedly
preferred the aromatic white and black
sage.</p>

<p>The foliage grew more and more dense; soon
the trees on either side arched over their heads;
the bed of the stream was now perfectly dry.
Just at the bend of a broad ca&#241;on they came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
upon more bushes, in some places as high as
trees and with a crown of dense, pale foliage at
their top.</p>

<p>"What are these?" inquired Mr. Page.
"Some are like dwarfs, others are giants, and
their trunks and stocks seem to have been
twisted by some convulsion of nature."</p>

<p>"That is the manganita&mdash;the Christmas berry
of California," said Francisco.</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," remarked Mr. Page. "When we
first came, don't you remember, mother, it reminded
us of the eastern holly."</p>

<p>"Yes," said his wife, "and it made me very
homesick to see it."</p>

<p>"It is always beautiful, the manganita," said
Mauricio. "About December, when it is warm
in the sheltered ca&#241;ons though there may be
snow in the mountains, the manganita puts
forth pretty, small white bells."</p>

<p>"Sometimes they are a little pink," said Francisco,
"and then they are prettier. When they
fall the shrub seems to grow stronger, and the
new shoots come forth scarlet and crimson.
They look beautiful with the green of the older
leaves."</p>

<p>"Again in the fall the fruit ripens," said
Mauricio, "and near to Christmas, when the
berries are a bright red, you begin to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
wagons loaded with the Christmas greens coming
down the mountain roads and going into the
city. Oh, I have often taken down a load; it
makes money for us."</p>

<p>"That manganita is the finest thing we
know," said Francisco. "Deep in the ground
are the roots; they make good fuel. We burn
them, and some sell them in town. You have,
maybe, burned the manganita roots, Mr. Page?"</p>

<p>"No, we have not," was the reply; "but if
you ever fetch us down a good load in the fall,
Francisco, we will burn them this winter."</p>

<p>"Very well; it shall be done," said the boy.
"I shall be glad to do so."</p>

<p>"It must be nearly lunch-time," ventured
Nellie. "I feel pretty hungry."</p>

<p>Her father looked at his watch. "It is only
eleven," he said, "but we had breakfast early.
There does not seem to be any level ground just
here. Shall we come to some after a while,
Mauricio?"</p>

<p>"Soon," replied the Indian. "Wait a while
and you will see. There will be water, good
water, and we can make coffee."</p>

<p>The ascent had grown very steep; the horses
tugged slowly but willingly upward. Suddenly
they seemed to be at the top of the mountain.
The slope on the other side, becoming very gradual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
led into a broad, green, pleasant valley
fringed by luxuriant foliage.</p>

<p>"How beautiful!" was the general exclamation.</p>

<p>"It seems like an enchanted valley," said
Aunt Mary. "If you will observe, it forms an
almost perfect circle. That lovely fringe of
green surrounding it&mdash;the foot-hills just above&mdash;and
those magnificent mountains in the background&mdash;it
does indeed make one think of an
enchanted valley."</p>

<p>"Once it <i>was encantado</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> rejoined Mauricio.</p>

<p>"What is it called? Has it any name?" asked
Walter.</p>

<p>The Indians smiled and looked at each other.</p>

<p>"You will not be frightened if I tell you?"
asked Mauricio. "The danger is past&mdash;nothing
can hurt you. The spell is long since broken."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell us!" cried Nellie. "We won't be
frightened."</p>

<p>"It is called '<i>El Valle de los Cascabeles</i>'&mdash;'The
Valley of the Rattlesnakes.'"</p>

<p>"Ugh!" exclaimed Nellie. "Are there rattlesnakes
down there?"</p>

<p>"Not any more, I think; perhaps never any
there," answered Mauricio. "But there is a
story."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>"A story? Oh, do tell it to us," cried the
children.</p>

<p>"You see, as we come nearer," replied the
Indian, "that in the centre is a large, round
spot where nothing is growing&mdash;no grass, no
bush, no tree."</p>

<p>It was true. In strange contrast to the fresh
verdure all around, this single, bald, unlovely
spot, black as though fire had burned it, stood
forth.</p>

<p>"Once, very long ago," said Mauricio, "there
lived a tribe of Indians in those mountains over
there where the Volcan smokes. They came
every year here to this valley for their <i>fiesta</i>&mdash;all
the tribe. Once they were at war with some
others who dwelt beyond the Volcan, near to the
peaks of the Cuyamaca. Then it happened that
the son of the chief of the Volcans was wounded
and captured in a fight, and they took him to
the camp of the Cuyamacas, and there he was
tended by the women.</p>

<p>"Then, when he was well and able to go again
back to his own people, he vowed that he would
have for his wife the daughter of the chief of
the Cuyamacas, the fairest of her tribe, and that
there should be peace forever between the Cuyamacas
and the Volcans. Now, the chief of the
Cuyamacas was very, very old, and he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
unwilling that peace should be before he died.
Not so the chief of the Volcans. He called
down all the wrath of the great spirit on his son,
and the young man, angered at his father, swore
that he would disobey him and join the side of
the enemy against him. 'The great good spirit
will desert thee,' said his father. 'Thou and
thy posterity shall be accursed.'</p>

<p>"'Then I call upon the spirit of evil to aid
me,' said the rash young brave, and bursting
away from his father he betook himself to this
valley. When he reached it he saw in the
middle of the broad space a large, flat stone
which before had not been in the valley. And
a voice said in his ear: 'Lift up the stone.'
But he said: 'I can not; it is twenty times
broader, and many times heavier than I.'
'Lift up the stone,' said the voice again.</p>

<p>"Then he obeyed, and there came forth a legion
of rattlesnakes, scattering in every direction;
but they touched him not. He slept, and in the
morning returned to the camp of the Cuyamacas
and married the daughter of the chief. But the
people did not trust him, and his wife taunted
him with his ingratitude to his parents. He
bowed his head and went forth once more. In
the bitterness of his grief he wandered to the
valley, and there he saw lying dead around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
ashes of a camp-fire many braves and squaws
and papooses of his tribe. His father and
mother were there, and his sisters and his fellow-braves.
All about them were the cascabeles
darting to and fro, and then he knew that the
evil spirit had done this thing because he had
called upon him for aid.</p>

<p>"So he lay down in the centre of the valley,
where the stone had been, and he cried out: 'I
renounce you, O Spirit of Evil! Be it done
unto me, O Spirit of Good, as it has been done
unto my people.' Then there came a great fire
out of the earth beneath him, and even to his
bones he was destroyed. But perhaps he was
thus purified from his sin. Since that time this
place has been known as the 'Valley of the
Rattlesnakes.' Where the young chief was
burned no blade of grass has since grown."</p>

<p>"A very interesting story," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"But who told of it if they were all dead?"
queried Walter, a little skeptical.</p>

<p>Mauricio shrugged his shoulders. "That I
can not say," he replied. "It was an old story
long before my grandfather was born."</p>

<p>"And what became of the rattlesnakes? Are
any of their descendants living among those
bushes?" asked Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"If they are," said Aunt Mary, "I think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
ought to camp somewhere else for lunch and
rest."</p>

<p>"We shall not be near the bushes," said Mauricio,
"and there is no other place near where
we can stop to eat."</p>

<p>"You will never see a snake in an open place
like this," said Francisco. "There is no danger."</p>

<p>"We will stop now," said Mr. Page. They
were at the edge of the circular green basin, and
Mauricio pulled up the horses. The party left
the wagon, glad to stretch their limbs after so
long a ride. A couch of robes and blankets was
made for Mrs. Page under a tree. Aunt Mary
sat down beside her, and the others busied themselves
in spreading out the lunch.</p>

<p>"Come; I will show you a pretty sight," said
Francisco to the children, taking a tin pail from
the wagon. They followed him to the bushes,
in the midst of which stood a large sycamore
tree, the only one to be seen. Putting aside its
luxuriant boughs, the Indian boy disclosed a
sparkling spring tumbling down from the rocks
above.</p>

<p>"This it is which makes the valley so green,"
he said, "and the bushes to grow everywhere."
The water was icy cold. "It is an iron spring,"
continued Francisco, "and good for many diseases.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Many persons camp in this section.
There are pretty little spots all around."</p>

<p>"See that rock above the spring?" asked Nellie,
pointing to the spot. "It looks like an armchair
with a flat back and a broad seat. It
must be lovely to sit up there and listen to the
trickle, trickle of the water over the pebbles."</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said Francisco.
"Many times as I have been here, I have never
thought of that. But so it is."</p>

<p>When they returned with the water Aunt
Mary made the coffee, and luncheon was ready.
Afterward Mr. Page and Mauricio walked up
and down, discussing the coming eviction of the
Indians; Mrs. Page and Aunt Mary were resting;
Francisco and Walter were cutting twigs
for whistles.</p>

<p>For some time Nellie wandered about alone
till finally her steps turned in the direction of
the iron spring. She had a strong desire to sit
in the natural armchair she had discovered. It
was just like what a girl in a story-book would
do, she thought.</p>

<p>For some moments she stood watching the
clear, sparkling water falling over the stones;
then, stepping across the little stream she
climbed up on the other side and seated herself
on the broad rock, her feet resting on the turfy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
grass beneath. It was very pleasant to sit in
that shady nook, to watch the sunlight filter
through the green leaves of the sycamore, and
listen to the singing of the tiny waterfall.</p>

<p>Nellie was tired; she had been up since dawn.
Pulling off her sun-bonnet, she leaned her head
against the flat, cool stone that formed the back
of the comfortable seat.</p>

<p>"Whiz&mdash;whiz&mdash;whiz!" went something close
behind her. Leaning back, she tried to locate
the sound. "It is like a corn-crake," she
thought. "But I never heard anything <i>just</i> like
it. Can it be a bird?"</p>

<p>"Whiz&mdash;whiz!" she heard again, but now the
sound receded and presently ceased.</p>

<p>"I wonder if it could have been a big grasshopper,"
thought the child, once more resuming
her restful position. In a moment she was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>"Nellie! Nellie!" called her father; but she
did not hear him.</p>

<p>"Nellie! Nellie!" repeated Walter a few moments
later.</p>

<p>The child slept on, while the golden light still
trickled through the leaves, and the silvery
water sang its one, unchanging song. Something
that had crawled away, something Nellie
had mercifully not seen!&mdash;long, lithe, slender,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
sinuous, horrible, with slimy skin and loathsome
head and glittering eyes&mdash;began slowly to return,
creeping toward the child in the sylvan
chair.</p>

<p>She did not awake, for the crawling thing
made no perceptible sound. The bushes parted.
Francisco was there, hearing, seeing, and in
an instant, leaping the stream, springing to her
side.</p>

<p>In a moment she was in his arms, wide-awake
and frightened; but the creeping creature the
Indian boy had seen with its head erect and
fangs exposed had vanished in the bushes, despoiled
of its prey. Another instant, and they
all had surrounded the little girl. Alarmed by
Walter's shriek, for he also had seen the snake,
they had run to the spot.</p>

<p>When everyone had grown calm again, they
looked about for Francisco. While they were
wondering where he had gone and why, the boy
came crashing through the brushwood, carrying
upon a stout stick a rattlesnake more than six
feet long.</p>

</div>


<p>When Nellie saw the reptile she grew white
from fear and aversion.</p>

<p>"Oh, take it away! take it away!" she cried.
"I can't bear to look at it."</p>

<p>Francisco flung it into the bushes.</p>

<p>"Some would stuff it and keep it," he said.
"And some make belts of it. But you shall
never see it again, my good little Nellie, if you
do not wish." Later he told Walter that he
would get the snake again, hide it in the wagon
when the child was not looking, and sell it to
someone at the Springs. It was unusually large
and venomous, and loud were the thanks Francisco
received on all sides for the rescue.</p>

<p>"Weren't you afraid, my boy?" asked Aunt
Mary, placing her hand on Francisco's arm.</p>

<p>"No, I was not afraid," said the boy. "Often
I have killed a rattlesnake before."</p>

<p>"But were you not fearful that it would
spring at you, or on Nellie, if you made a
noise? Or that it might fix its eyes upon you
and hold you there?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; it is not true that they can do that,"
said Francisco, "unless, perhaps, with birds,
who are so very little that they stand still with
fear. The snakes run away when they hear a
noise; they are afraid of noise and of men."</p>

<p>"There is probably a nest of snakes in the
bushes," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"I think so," replied Francisco. "Shall we
look?"</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not for us," said Mrs. Page. "Let
us get as far away from here as we can, as
soon as we can. The thought of the danger the
child escaped makes me nervous and afraid."</p>

<p>"Strange that you did not hear it in the
bushes," said Francisco.</p>

<p>"I did," responded Nellie. "I am sure I did.
It went 'whiz&mdash;whiz,' like a corn-crake or a
grasshopper, or those funny little windmills you
take in your hand and whirl around, mamma.
Why, it made me feel sleepy to listen to it; I
know it made me go to sleep&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was the rattle," said Francisco.</p>

<p>Mauricio was already putting the horses into
the wagon, and in a few moments they were
leaving the beautiful green valley behind, although
they did not retrace the route they had
taken that morning.</p>

<p>Mauricio, wishing to show them the source of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
the iron spring, suggested that they make a circuit,
which would bring them eventually to the
road. All agreed. When they came opposite
the bare spot where the immolation of the Indian
was supposed to have taken place Walter
asked:</p>

<p>"What became of the huge stone under which
the snakes were hidden, Mauricio?"</p>

<p>"I do not know," replied the Indian; "I
have never heard. Maybe it crumbled to pieces
after awhile, or maybe it disappeared as suddenly
as it came."</p>

<p>"I went over there this morning, or, rather,
Francisco and I did," said Walter, "and we believe,
at least I do, that there is nothing peculiar
about the spot at all. You can see there have
been a great many fires there&mdash;that is why nothing
grows."</p>

<p>"No Indian would make a fire there," said
Francisco.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you?" queried Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"No, I would not," said the boy. "I would be
afraid."</p>

<p>"I would just love to try it," said Walter.
"If we were going to stay longer I would."</p>

<p>"And then maybe you would be burned up,
like the bad brave of long ago," said Mauricio,
laughing.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we've had one experience to-day; that
is enough, Walter," said his mother. "I am
not afraid anything might happen, but do not
think I would allow you to go against all the
traditions of the place. The legend is undoubtedly
obscure, but <i>something</i> must have happened
there. We have had evidence enough to-day
that there are some rattlesnakes about and that
the valley deserves its name. I do not think
I can ever look at a rattlesnake's skin again."</p>

<p>When they left the valley the road wound up
a long, moderately steep ascent overlooking another
valley similar to the one they had just
left, but much smaller.</p>

<p>"One might truly call this a hidden nook,"
remarked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"And that is what they call it," said Mauricio,
'<i>El Valle Escondido</i>'&mdash;the hidden valley.
"Over there at the edge of the brush is a camp."</p>

<p>When they came nearer they met several Indian
children with long, slender reeds in their
hands.</p>

<p>"They have gathered them by the stream, and
they are taking them to be softened," explained
Mauricio. "It is of those that they make baskets."</p>

<p>"The famous Indian baskets?" inquired Aunt
Mary.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mauricio. "There under that
tent is a woman weaving one, and just across
sits a man making a mat."</p>

<p>They now saw that they were in the midst of
a genuine Indian camp.</p>

<p>"Do those people belong to Cupa?" asked Mr.
Page of Mauricio.</p>

<p>"No," he replied; "they are the Volcans&mdash;they
live up there behind the mountains, but
come here in the summer to get the reeds. Always
at this season you will find them here.
They come and go."</p>

<p>Under hastily erected brushwood dwellings
quite a number of persons, mostly women, were
seated. They accosted Mauricio and Francisco
in their own tongue. "They ask if we will stay
a little," said Mauricio, turning to Mr. Page.</p>

<p>Mrs. Page and Aunt Mary both expressing
themselves as much interested, the party
alighted and walked about the camp. A large
portion of the luncheon had been left. This
Mauricio distributed among the Indians, after
Mr. Page had inquired whether they would accept
it. They did not seem so intelligent as the
Cupa Indians and looked much poorer. This,
Francisco explained, was because they had not
had so much intercourse with the white people.</p>

<p>The process of basket-weaving appeared to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
slow. The material was soaking in earthern
jars, one long strand at a time being woven in
and out, apparently without design. However,
this is not the case. Wonderfully beautiful
shapes these baskets assume under the skilful
hands of the weaver.</p>

<p>The rug-maker, a man past ninety, with bent
shoulders and white hair, smilingly held up his
work for examination. It was of coarser material
than that of the baskets and the work
went much faster.</p>

<p>"He has all he can do, old Feliciano," said
Mauricio. "His son is blind. He cannot work,
and his grandson, with whom he lives, has lost
the use of his limbs. There are two little girls
and a boy, and the mother is dead. With the
work of his hands that old man supports <i>four</i>
generations. He is teaching it now to his granddaughters,
but he tells me that they do not care
much to learn it."</p>

<p>"Will he sell us a mat?" asked Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"Yes, if he has one there. They are nearly
always sold before they are finished. The people
at the Springs buy them, and now the stores
are selling them. They wear very well."</p>

<p>Feliciano had two or three mats on hand.
Mrs. Page bought them all.</p>

<p>"Come and see this primitive cooking-stove,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
said Mr. Page, who had been passing from one
tent to another.</p>

<p>A little removed from the rest a brush-shed,
open on every side, was being used as a kitchen.
A large hole in the roof gave egress to the
smoke. A circular wall of round, flat stones
about a foot in height had been erected; within
this wall the fire had been made. A huge black
pot containing an appetizing stew was steaming
on the embers. In front of it, in an upright
pan, a rabbit was roasting. A woman was peeling
potatoes, another cutting green tomatoes
and mixing them with mango peppers.</p>

<p>"All <i>that</i> goes into the pot," said Francisco.
"Don't you like the smell?"</p>

<p>"Will everybody eat out of that pot?" inquired
Aunt Mary, to whom this primitive
method did not strongly appeal.</p>

<p>"No one will eat out of it but the dogs&mdash;what
is left," laughed Francisco. "There are
dishes and plates and knives and forks in every
house. But everybody will have some of it, for
each has helped to provide the food. To-day
one does the cooking, or two, or three, and to-morrow
others."</p>

<p>After smiling adieux from the Indians the
party resumed its journey. On the opposite
side of the hill they came to another camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
much more attractive in appearance than that
of the Volcans.</p>

<p>"These are some of the Santa Isabel Indians,"
said Mauricio. "They live in the valleys
hereabout, but farther back among the mountains.
There was once a church for them, and
a very good one, of adobe&mdash;now nothing but
the walls remain. But they are going to build
another. The priest comes once a year."</p>

<p>"Do they have Mass then?" asked Mrs. Page.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Mauricio. "They have it
in the brush-house over there. Did you not see
the bells when you came?"</p>

<p>"No; we did not notice them," said Mr.
Page.</p>

<p>"They are always photographed by visitors,"
remarked Francisco. "They came from old
Spain. They are the finest toned in California;
there is much gold and silver in them."</p>

<p>"We shall have to look at them on our way
home," said Aunt Mary. "I am greatly interested
in such things."</p>

<p>"They are more than two hundred years old,"
said Mauricio. "The Volcans and Santa Isabels
are very proud of them."</p>

<p>And now once more they were at the top of
the ascent overlooking a valley much smaller
than either of the others. Behind this rose an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
almost perpendicular hill covered with an undergrowth
of various kinds of bushes.</p>

<p>Two snow-white tents were pitched at its base.
In front of one of them a young girl lay reading
in a hammock. At her feet a boy was making
a bow and arrow. In the door of the tent
an old lady, with a white, fleecy shawl thrown
over her shoulders and a lace scarf over her
snow-white hair, was knitting.</p>

<p>"They are the Almirantes," said Francisco
in a whisper to Miss Nellie and Walter. "They
come every year to the Iron Spring."</p>

<p>Respectfully saluting the old lady, who arose
at their approach, the party was about to pass on
when, coming forward, she said, "How do you do,
Mauricio and Francisco? And how is Cecilio?"</p>

<p>"All are well, Se&#241;ora," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And you are from the Springs&mdash;driving for
the day?" she continued, courteously addressing
Mrs. Page. Being answered in the affirmative,
she said:</p>

<p>"I am the Se&#241;ora Almirante; I live with my
grandchildren at the ranch not far from San
Diego. We come to this place every year for
the last five&mdash;no, four years. I find it does me
a great deal of good."</p>

<p>Mr. Page then introduced himself and his
family.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, can it be that you are the friends of
the Gordons, our neighbors, of whom we have
heard them speak so often? Father Gregorio
told me also that you had been living in California,
and had now decided to remain here."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," replied Mrs. Page, "the Gordons
are old friends. We were disappointed on
coming out to learn that they had gone East
again."</p>

<p>"Well, it is only for a time, you know," said
the Se&#241;ora. "It is only to settle some business,
and then they will return."</p>

<p>"Ramona," she continued, addressing the
young lady in the hammock, "come here to be
made acquainted with some friends of the Gordons.
And you also, Alejandro," to the boy.</p>

<p>They came forward, the girl tall, dark and
slender, with a crown of magnificent jet-black
hair wound round and round her small head;
the boy, several years younger than his sister,
but very much resembling her in feature.</p>

<p>"Any friends of the Gordons we are very glad
to know," said Ramona Almirante in response
to the kindly greetings of Mr. and Mrs. Page.
"What a pity you are not camping here with
us at the Spring. It is so pleasant."</p>

<p>Walter and Alejandro were by this time conversing
like old friends. But the day was wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
on. Mauricio reminded them that there
was considerable traveling to be done before
sundown, and they were compelled to say good-by.
In the few moments' intercourse they had
had the Pages were charmed with the Se&#241;ora
and her grandchildren. She promised to call
at their home in the city in October, when she
expected to make her usual yearly trip.</p>

<p>"Will you not come to the Springs for a day
before returning to town?" asked Mrs. Page.
"We could manage to entertain you pleasantly,
and even put you up for the night."</p>

<p>A slight change passed over the Se&#241;ora's
countenance.</p>

<p>"I thank you very much," she replied. "I
do not go there&mdash;I do not like the place; but
we shall soon meet again. With friends of the
Gordons we <i>must</i> be friends."</p>

<p>"What charming persons," remarked Aunt
Mary as they drove on. "If all the old Spanish
families were like this one, I do not wonder that
poets and story-writers lament their passing
away."</p>

<p>"Many are like them," rejoined Mauricio.
"The Se&#241;ora has done much good in her time.
Once they were a very rich family."</p>

<p>"How very dark the girl and boy are," said
Mrs. Page.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>"The boy, mother&mdash;the boy looks like Francisco.
Don't you think so, Mauricio?" asked
Walter.</p>

<p>"I have never thought of it," the Indian replied.
Francisco said nothing.</p>

<p>They had not gone far when they met two
Indians, a man and a woman, both considerably
advanced in years, carrying bundles of fagots on
their shoulders.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay!" called Mauricio. "<i>Como estan
ustedes, Concilio Valeriano?</i>"</p>

<p>The couple halted.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Mauricio! We did not know you.
We are not so young as we once were," the old
man said. "We do not see so well."</p>

<p>"But you are strong and well still," rejoined
Mauricio. "We have been at the camp. We
have seen the Se&#241;ora. These ladies and gentlemen
I have been giving a ride to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the old woman; "and is
this not Francisco?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the boy; "am I grown tall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, and handsome, too!" exclaimed
the old woman. "We are glad to have seen
you. How is Cecilio, and Maria, and Juan
Diego?"</p>

<p>"All are well," replied Mauricio. "<i>Adios.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Adios!</i>" rejoined the pair and, bowing politely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
to the occupants of the wagon, they
passed on.</p>

<p>"They are the servants of the Se&#241;ora," said
Mauricio, when they had resumed their way.
"They have lived many, many years with her.
They are related to us, both husband and wife."</p>

<p>The moon had risen when they reached the
camp. Charlie was awaiting them with a good
dinner. Mrs. Page insisted that Mauricio and
Francisco partake.</p>

<p>When the rest of the family had retired Mr.
Page, not feeling sleepy, went out for a walk
and a smoke.</p>

<p>Near the springs he met the stage-driver,
about to fill a pail with hot water. After having
told him of their drive and the meeting
with the Almirantes, Mr. Page said:</p>

<p>"They seem to be very fine people."</p>

<p>"They are&mdash;what is left of them," rejoined
old Chadwick. "Forty year I've known them.
The old Se&#241;ora is as proud as Lucifer. Captain,
I can tell you that, nice as she is. She's
never got over that mistake of her son&mdash;never
will; though she's a mother to both them
children."</p>

<p>"What mistake was that?" inquired Mr.
Page.</p>

<p>"Why, didn't you notice how dark them two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
are? Didn't Mauricio tell you nothing about
them?"</p>

<p>"No, he did not."</p>

<p>"Why, they're part Indian. Couldn't you see
it? Notice how fair the Se&#241;ora is beside them."</p>

<p>"Yes, but we never surmised that they had
Indian blood," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Well, they have, sir, good and strong. Their
mother is a full-blooded Indian, living on the
Mesa Grande&mdash;married again to a good fellow&mdash;Indian&mdash;up
there. She's a cousin to Mauricio
and Francisco. Lots of their relations living
round here. That's why the Se&#241;ora never
comes to Warner's. I don't blame her&mdash;it's a
bitter pill."</p>

<p>"It must have gone hard with her," said Mr.
Page.</p>

<p>"It did. Yet she took that girl when she
was a baby, and has raised her ever since. They
do say she never knew she was part Indian until
four or five years ago. The old lady took
the boy then&mdash;he was at the mission school.
Now she sends him up to Santa Clara. They're
fine children&mdash;the image of their father, both
of them. Miss Ramona, she's a perfect lady
if there ever was one."</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Page said to Mauricio:</p>

<p>"Chadwick told me the story of the Almirante<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
children last night. I know now why it is
that Francisco looks like the boy."</p>

<p>"Yes?" replied Mauricio. "Chadwick talks
too much, I think. Still, everybody knows it.
But it would not have been for either Francisco
or myself to have been the first to tell of that
which has caused the Se&#241;ora so much unhappiness."</p>

<p>Which Mr. Page considered, and justly, another
admirable trait in the Indian whom he
had already learned to admire and respect.</p>




<hr />

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="small">THE "JUNTA."</span></h2>
</div>


<p>The Pages had been six weeks at the Hot
Springs. The invalid, quite recovered, was able
to join them in all their expeditions. The
children had enjoyed every waking moment of
their stay, and the sleeping moments also, it
might be said, if one should judge of that by the
soundness of their repose.</p>

<p>"Our vacation is nearly over," said Mr. Page
one morning, looking up from a letter he had
been reading.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," cried Walter and his sister, "do
we have to go home soon?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>"Pretty soon," was the reply. "This letter
calls me home. Mr. Dillon has business in Arizona,
and wants to start not later than the first
of September."</p>

<p>Mr. Dillon was Mr. Page's partner. He had
already postponed his departure beyond the time
originally set. Mr. Page did not feel that he
could ask him to do so again, and the elder
members of the party were beginning to feel
that home would be welcome.</p>

<p>Not so the children. Rugged with health,
bubbling over with happiness, and almost as
brown as the young Indians, they deplored the
necessity of leaving a spot with which they had
become thoroughly familiar, and whose strange,
peculiar people they had learned to know and
love. The Indians are slow to make friends
among the whites, but their confidence once
given, they do not soon withdraw it. Walter
and Nellie had long since been initiated into
the mysteries of herb gathering, fruit drying,
blanket and basket weaving, rug making and
beef jerking. They could talk quite intelligently
on all these subjects.</p>

<p>That which interested them most, appealing
strongly to their tender sympathies, was the
subject of the removal of the Indians from the
Springs.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"They talk of it everywhere we go," said the
boy to his father one evening. "They are always
asking us if we think perhaps the government
will let them stay, papa, and what <i>you</i>
think of it.</p>

<p>"We always tell them that it isn't the government
that is putting them out, but they can't
understand that. They say if the government
can buy them or give them another home they
might just as well let them stay. I think it is
dreadful, dreadful for the people to drive them
away."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is both sad and unjust, it seems to
me," said their father; "but such has been the
fate of the Indian ever since the white man
landed on these shores. It has always been
'move on, move on'&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Till there isn't any more land to move to,"
interrupted Walter.</p>

<p>"There is going to be a <i>Junta</i> to-morrow or
the day after," said Nellie. "The commissioners
are coming to talk to them."</p>

<p>"A good many of them think they won't have
to go, because Mr. Lummis is coming, papa,"
said Walter.</p>

<p>"That will not make any difference in one
way," said their father, "though it may in another.
Mr. Lummis is a true friend of the Indians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
He will exert all his efforts to have
them removed to a desirable place, where there
will be plenty of water, fertile soil, and every
other favorable condition."</p>

<p>"I heard a man say the other day to Captain
Blacktooth that the Indians had not been here
more than twenty-five years."</p>

<p>"And what did Cecilio answer?"</p>

<p>"He said, pointing to the graveyard: 'Look
at our graves on the hillside. Some of those
crosses crumble like ashes. Touch one, it falls
to pieces in your hand. And yet there are
crosses there fifty years old that have not begun
to crumble or fall.'"</p>

<p>"What did the man say to that argument?"</p>

<p>"He said wood rotted very fast in this
country."</p>

<p>"Which is not true," rejoined Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Then Cecilio said, in the most scornful way:
'You can read in the reports of the lawsuit that
one of the white commanders wrote more than
fifty years ago that the Indians at Warner's
Ranch were made to work by flogging them.
Now you flog us no longer, but you do as bad, or
worse. That was before I was born, yet you
say we were not here twenty-five years back.
You would better study the case first before you
say such things.'"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>"Then Cecilio went away," said Nellie, "and
the man said he would like to flog <i>him</i>&mdash;Cecilio."</p>

<p>"It was funny about Francisco, then, papa,"
said Walter. "He was coming with a big bucket
of water, and he stumbled over that man's foot
and spilled a lot."</p>

<p>"Was the man angry?" asked his father, with
a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, very!"</p>

<p>"And Francisco?"</p>

<p>"He said, 'Oh, excuse me,' and went on.
When I told him he was not always so awkward
as that, he laughed and said: 'Sometimes I am
awkward, Walter. Sometimes I have been, and
perhaps I will be again,' And he never smiled,
papa&mdash;just walked along with his eyes on the
ground. I am sure he did it purposely."</p>

<p>"Yes, I think he did," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"But you don't think it was any harm, do
you?" inquired Nellie.</p>

<p>"No, I don't," was the reply.</p>

<p>"I'd have emptied the whole bucket on his
head if I had been an Indian," said Walter.
"Those people are too patient."</p>

<p>"And so you would be, my son, if you had
been hunted for five hundred years as they have
been," said Mr. Page.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>Early the next morning there was an unusual
stir in the village. The Indians had donned
their best clothes, and a general air of expectation
pervaded everything. All eyes seemed to
turn in the direction of the Cold Spring, from
which it was expected the visitors would arrive.
At last a carriage was seen approaching, and
all the natives were out to meet it. After
luncheon in the restaurant the people followed
the commissioners to the schoolhouse, where
Mr. Charles Lummis explained the case to them
as clearly as it was possible to do. They listened
in respectful silence, and then went slowly
and silently away.</p>

<p>The next morning they reassembled.</p>

<p>"Have you thought about what was said yesterday?"
asked one of the commissioners.</p>

<p>"Yes," came in a low murmur from the
crowd.</p>

<p>"And what have you to say?"</p>

<p>"That we wish to stay here in our homes,"
answered Captain Cecilio.</p>

<p>"But that is impossible. You have been told
that it cannot be. This land does not belong
to you any more. The law has so decided it."</p>

<p>"If once it was ours, why not still? We have
not sold it. We have not given it away; we have
not left it. Why, then, is it not our own?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>"That has already been explained. You allowed
the time to pass without presenting your
claim until it was too late."</p>

<p>"But we did not know, and our old men did
not know," cried Cecilio in a loud voice.</p>

<p>"The law takes no account of that."</p>

<p>"It is not just; we do not understand the
law."</p>

<p>"Nor we, at all times. But it has been decided,
and it cannot be changed. Think now
of the outside country that you know, and make
up your minds where you wish to go. The government
will do what it is best for you."</p>

<p>"Let us go to the Great Father in Washington
and plead with him&mdash;I and some of my
people," requested Cecilio.</p>

<p>"It cannot be. It would be useless. There
is only one thing to be done."</p>

<p>"And that thing we shall never do of our
own free will," cried Cecilio, flinging out his
arms and shaking his black locks in the face of
the speaker.</p>

<p>Then began a loud talk in the Cupe&#241;o language,
for in this emergency the Spanish failed
them. The white men waited quietly until the
tumult had subsided, knowing that it was best
to let them give vent to their feelings so long
repressed. At length a fine-looking young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
woman stepped forward and, without the least
embarrassment, offered to translate the answers
of her people into the Spanish tongue.<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<p>"We thank you for coming here to speak with
us," she said, as courteously as any lady in the
land.</p>

<p>"We thank you for coming here to talk with
us in a way we can understand. It is the first
time any one has done so. They have said,
'You must go, you must go,' but they have not
told us, assembled together, <i>why</i> we must go.
Some of our old people have never believed it
till now, and some of us will not yet believe
that it can happen.</p>

<p>"You ask us to think what place we like next
best to this place, where we always have lived.
You see that graveyard out there? There are
our fathers and our grandfathers. You see that
Eagle-nest Mountain, and that Rabbit-hole
Mountain? When God made them he gave
us this place. We have always been here;
we do not care for any other place. It may
be good, but it is not ours. We have always
lived here, we would rather die here. Our fathers
did; we cannot leave them. Our children
were born here&mdash;how can we go away? If you
give us the best place in the world it is not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
good for us as this. The Captain he say his
people cannot go anywhere else; they cannot
live anywhere else. Here they always live; their
people always live here. There is no other place.
This is our home. We ask you to get it for us.
The Indians always here. We stay here.
Everybody knows this is Indian land. These
Hot Springs always Indian. We cannot live
anywhere else. We were born here, and our
fathers are buried here. We do not think of
any place after this. We want this place and
not any other place."</p>

<p>"But if the government cannot buy this place
for you, then what would you like next best?"</p>

<p>"There is no other place for us. We do not
want you to buy any other place. If you will
not buy this place we will go into the mountains
like quail and die there, the old people
and the women and children. Let the government
be glad and proud. It can kill us. We
do not fight; we do what it says. If we cannot
live here we want to go into those mountains
and die. We do not want any other home."</p>

<p>It was useless to parley with the poor Cupe&#241;os.
That they would receive the value and
more than the value of their houses, that they
would be given material to build other and better
dwellings, that soil as fertile and water as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
abundant would be found for them, that they
would be provided with new agricultural tools,
that they would be transported free of charge
to their new home&mdash;none of these things availed.
To each and every argument they made the
same reply:</p>

<p>"We want no other place, we want no new
houses, or lands, or tools for farming. This is
our home, here let us stay. Or, if you will not,
let us go into the mountains and die."</p>

<p>It was very pathetic. Not only Walter and
Nellie, but their father also, wiped away more
than one sympathetic tear as, standing on the
edge of the crowd, they listened to that soulful
cry, nearly as old as the world:</p>

<p>"Here is our home, here let us stay. Die we
can and will, but give up our homes we cannot."</p>

<p>The commissioners, unable to make any impression
upon the Indians, soon departed, all of
them deeply affected by the proceedings.</p>

<p>They had now nothing to do but continue
their search for available lands, fearing it might
yet come to pass that the Indians would have
to be ejected by force from their homes.</p>

<p>In groups of two or three, the men together,
the women and children following, but all composed,
all silent, they went to their several
dwellings. It had been a sorrowful day in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Cupa; every hope raised by the expectation of
meeting the commissioners had been dashed to
the ground. Mr. Page and the children walked
silently back to the camp, longing to exchange
words of sympathy with these humble friends,
yet respecting their silent grief too deeply to intrude
upon it.</p>

<p>"Children, you will never forget this day,"
said their father. "Let it, then, always be a
lesson to you, though it is not likely either of
you will be called upon to decide the destiny
of any nation, or part of a nation, however
small. From his point of view, the present
owner of Warner's Ranch has a perfect, undeniable
right to occupy these lands, and so he
has in the eyes of the law. He is not an unkindly
man, I am told, nor is he a poor man.
Yet it would seem that now he has neglected a
grand opportunity for doing a generous action
and gaining not only the gratitude of these
poor people, but the admiration and respect of
the whole country.</p>

<p>"However, it seems he cannot find it in his
heart to allot them their beloved nine hundred
acres out of his broad possessions, numbering
thirty thousand. It has been said truly by the
wisest lips that ever spoke: 'It is easier for a
camel to pass through the eye of a needle than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
for a rich man to enter the kingdom of
heaven.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="small">THE RETURN.</span></h2>
</div>


<p>On the morning after the <i>Junta</i> Dionysio returned
from the large ranch where he had been
helping the harvesters. Or, rather, he returned
on the evening of that day, but came down to
the Pages' camp in the morning.</p>

<p>Margarita, in her pretty red dress and new
shoes and stockings, came to meet him, with
many childish expressions of joy. He took her
in his arms, fondled her cheek against his, and
said in Spanish:</p>

<p>"<i>Querida</i>, you love your brother?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>," replied the child. "Dionysio knows it
well."</p>

<p>"And you love also the white people who
have been so kind to you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Si</i>, very much," was the reply.</p>

<p>"And would you be willing, <i>Querida</i>, to go
far away with them to stay?"</p>

<p>"Will you come, too?" asked the child.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>Dionysio shook his head and looked at her
steadfastly.</p>

<p>"Not to see you any more?"</p>

<p>Again he shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then I shall not go. Where my Dionysio
stays there will I stay. You will not send me
away."</p>

<p>"No, my sweet one, I shall not send you
away."</p>

<p>He put her down and sought Mr. Page, who
was smoking back of the tent. After they had
exchanged a few remarks he said:</p>

<p>"Last night I had a long talk with Cecilio.
He thinks it is not well that I give my little
sister to the white people. And Cecilio knows.
Good and kind you will be to her, I am sure;
but if you die, and your wife&mdash;then what? And
even before that? If you keep her like one of
yourselves, no other white people will do so&mdash;then
where is she? Thrown on the world like
so many have been&mdash;a stranger to her people,
not wanted by the others&mdash;what is to become of
her then? And even if I am living she will
have forgotten me. Is it not right what I
say?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in some respects it is," answered Mr.
Page. "But we were speaking of the child last
night, Dionysio&mdash;my wife and aunt and myself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
My aunt has formed quite an affection for the
little one, and proposed that she should take her
back to the East, educate her, and have her for
a companion."</p>

<p>"Your aunt is no longer young," replied
Dionysio.</p>

<p>"No, she is not young."</p>

<p>"And when she dies, what then?"</p>

<p>"You may be sure the child would be well
provided for."</p>

<p>"That may be true. But it is the same thing.
She would still be alone."</p>

<p>"You have the right to decide, Dionysio,"
said Mr. Page. "She belongs to you. What
would you do with her? Would you send her
to the Mission until she is grown?"</p>

<p>"Then she would not care for me, maybe.
No; I think not the Mission."</p>

<p>"But she would learn to read, then, and to
sew, and to cook, and to be neat."</p>

<p>"I can teach her to read, and our women&mdash;some
of them, can cook well and sew."</p>

<p>"But you do not mean that you and she will
live alone together? You are away so often&mdash;how
could you manage it?"</p>

<p>A smile appeared on the stolid face of the
Indian, and a little shamefacedly he replied:</p>

<p>"You have been good to the child, Mr. Page,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and to me. I will tell you: On the ranch where
I have been working there is an Indian family
in charge. The owners do not live there much.
These Indians are good people, and know well
how to keep house. The girl was for a time
at the Mission. That is where I will take my
little sister."</p>

<p>A light burst upon Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said laughingly. "You are going
to be married, Dionysio?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the Indian, also laughing.
"I am going to marry Victoria. It is all settled.
I can have work there as long as I wish."</p>

<p>"Then you do well to keep your sister," said
Mr. Page. "And I congratulate you, Dionysio;
you deserve a good wife."</p>

<p>And so it was that the little Indian girl who
had so endeared herself to the family was left
behind when they departed from the village.
Aunt Mary was sorely disappointed. She had
made many plans for the future of the child;
but on reflection she, too, saw that Dionysio's
plan was the most proper and natural. But
never did a small daughter of Cupa have a
neater or more attractive outfit than that which
arrived from town as soon as possible after the
Pages returned.</p>

<p>At last the morning came for their departure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
It seemed as though all the women and children
in the place had assembled to bid them good-by.</p>

<p>Alfonsa, almost hidden under pots, pans,
kettles, blankets and clothing which they had
given her, followed the wagon to the beginning
of the diverging road. Mauricio was absent,
but Francisco rode beside them as far as the
top of the mesa land which looked down upon
the village. There was regret in every heart as
they made their adieux, but they hoped to see
him again, for he had promised to bring them
a load of wood for the winter.</p>

<p>They did not forget to look out for the bells
of Santa Isabel. When near the end of the
first stage of the homeward journey they saw
them in the distance. The framework, gnarled
and blackened by age, looked like a gibbet
against the sky. When they came nearer Charlie
asked Walter if he did not want to get down
and ring the bells.</p>

<p>"What would the Indians think?" asked
Walter. "Might they not imagine they were
being called for something?"</p>

<p>"That's so," was the reply. "I did not mean
to ring them, exactly, but to strike them. They
have such a beautiful, clear tone. I have a fine
hickory stick here; do you want it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Walter; "give it to me."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>He left the wagon and, going up to the bells,
gave each a sharp, quick stroke on the side.
The sound reverberated again and again, filling
all the valley with its clear, musical tone.</p>

<p>"That is not how," said a voice beside him,
and an Indian boy about his own age suddenly
appeared as though from the earth. He had
been sleeping, however, in the shadow of the
bells, and the sound had awakened him.</p>

<p>Taking the stick from Walter's hand, he
touched them one after another, but softly and
slowly. How different were the echoing sounds
from those which Walter had evoked!</p>

<p>"You know how to do it," said Mr. Page,
handing him a quarter.</p>

<p>"It is in my family," said the boy gravely.
"My grandfather, he ring them, and my father,
and now I."</p>

<p>"Ah, I see," said Walter. "They are the
finest bells I ever heard."</p>

<p>"I think they are the best in the world,"
said the boy, still with the hickory stick in his
hand as they drove away. Charlie had forgotten
to ask him for it, and probably he was
not averse to keeping such a good defence
against snakes and reptiles.</p>

<p>As they proceeded across the valley they could
still hear at intervals the soft, delicious notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
played upon the ancient bells of his people by
him of the third generation of bell-ringers of
the fast diminishing, poverty-stricken but still
devout Santa Isabels.</p>

<p>They stopped at Ramona for the night, and
noon next day found them nearing home. Charlie
was about to turn into a delightful woodland
copse for luncheon when two ladies on horseback
were seen approaching. Mr. Page at once
recognized the Almirantes. The recognition was
mutual. The Se&#241;ora and the granddaughter
came to the wagon and shook hands cordially
with the occupants.</p>

<p>"Now you are only a mile and a half from
my home," she said. "I beg that you will come
and take dinner and pass the night with us."</p>

<p>At first they demurred, the party was so
large, but the Se&#241;ora was insistent.</p>

<p>"Come and see an old Spanish ranch house,"
she said. "You will possibly never see another.
Come, I beg of you; all that we have is yours."</p>

<p>Ramona, the granddaughter, joined her entreaties
to those of the Se&#241;ora, and the Pages
at last consented. The ladies rode ahead to
give notice of their coming, and when the party
reached the ranch everything was found in
readiness as though for long-expected guests.
Two neatly furnished bedrooms, each large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
enough for a salon, were placed at their disposal,
with plenty of water and fresh towels,
very welcome after the long and dusty morning
ride. Afterward, while waiting for dinner to
be served, they sat in the long, covered porch,
extending all around the large <i>patio</i>. There
beautiful plants and flowers were growing, and
several parrots hung in gilded cages.</p>

<p>When dinner was over the Se&#241;ora took the
elder ladies to show them her laces. Mr. Page
rambled in the gardens and fields. The children,
with Ramona and her brother, gathered at
the edge of the ruined fountain, watching the
toads that hopped over the rank moss.</p>

<p>"The Gordons are coming back soon," said
Alejandro. "Then we shall have fine times
again."</p>

<p>"But you will be at school," said his sister;
"you will not be here."</p>

<p>"In vacation I will," he replied. "I wish
I did not have to go back to school. I like it
when I am there, but I would rather stay at
home."</p>

<p>"What are you going to be when you are
a man?" asked Walter. "A lawyer or a
doctor?"</p>

<p>"Neither," said Alejandro. "I am going to
stay here and be a rancher. I mean to plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
the finest fruits, and put in nuts, and do everything
in the best possible way."</p>

<p>"That is so," laughed Ramona. "He is like
that. He will be a rancher, as he calls it. And
my grandmother will be pleased."</p>

<p>"Say, Alejandro," said Walter, who had been
attentively regarding the boy; "you won't be
mad if I tell you something, will you?"</p>

<p>The brother and sister looked at each other
and smiled.</p>

<p>"You are going to say I have very dark
skin, or something like that," said Alejandro.
"So many people do who do not know us."</p>

<p>"No, not that," replied Walter. "But it was
this&mdash;you look so much like Francisco, an Indian
boy we liked so much at the Hot Springs,
only you are not so dark."</p>

<p>"Francisco Perez?" asked Alejandro. "So
I ought&mdash;he is my cousin."</p>

<p>"Your <i>cousin</i>!" exclaimed Walter and Nellie.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is our cousin," repeated Alejandro,
stoutly. "He and Mauricio&mdash;and Cecilio&mdash;and
many others at Warner's. Our mother is an
Indian."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am sorry," said Walter, fearing he
had made a mistake. "I would not have said
anything&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And why not?" interrupted the other boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
"We are not ashamed of it, Ramona nor I. Our
mother is a good woman. Our father was the
son of my grandmother."</p>

<p>"Naturally," said Ramona, and they all
laughed, at the expense of Alejandro.</p>

<p>"I am not sure that I would have told you,"
said Alejandro, "only I knew that you did not
despise the poor Indians as some do&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Despise them!" exclaimed Nellie. "We like
them, and we love Francisco."</p>

<p>Ramona gave the child's hand an affectionate
little squeeze. Nellie looked up at her and
said:</p>

<p>"You are so sweet. I wish we had known
you all summer. And your hair is so lovely."
Ramona was wearing it in one long, heavy braid.
Nothing could have been more simple or becoming.</p>

<p>"We will be friends, then," she rejoined,
playfully. "We have so few. My grandmother
does not know the Americans well, but the Gordons
she likes a great deal. And now that they
are coming home and are your friends, we shall
be all friends together."</p>

<p>"That will be nice," said Nellie. "I hope
mamma will let me come and stay with you
sometimes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't call that nice," remarked Walter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
"inviting yourself to a visit when you are hardly
acquainted."</p>

<p>"Don't tease her," said Ramona. "She means
well, and she shall come and stay with me."</p>

<p>"You can't help asking her now," said Walter,
looking very glum. "I never knew her to be
so impolite and bold before."</p>

<p>"But Walter," said Nellie, "I meant for Ramona&mdash;may
I call you Ramona?&mdash;to come and
visit us, too. We are going to be great friends."</p>

<p>"Bold?" chuckled Alejandro, with a smile.
"That makes me think of something. When
I first went to Santa Clara I did not know
English as well as I do now, although I had
been at the Mission."</p>

<p>"With the Indians?" inquired Walter,
thoughtlessly.</p>

<p>"With the Indians&mdash;yes," said Alejandro.
"And why not? My mother put me there; it
was a good place, and I liked the Sisters very
much."</p>

<p>Walter looked mystified. Ramona hastened
to explain. "When he was little," she said,
"Alejandro did not live with us. I have been
with my grandmother since my father died.
Alejandro was a little baby then. Our mother
sent him, when he was old enough, to the
Mission."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>"And then my sister found me," added the
boy. "But for her I should never have come
here or known my grandmother."</p>

<p>"Well, that is too long a story," said Ramona.
"Maybe some other time you will hear
it, but not now. What were you going to say
before, 'Jandro?"</p>

<p>"About 'bold,'" replied her brother. "When
I first went up there some English words were
strange to me. Or, rather, I did not understand
their different meanings. One day a big
boy, a new one, too, said he did not like bold
girls. 'I like every one to be bold,' I said.
'Girls are horrid when they are bold,' said he.
'Sometimes they have to be,' I said. 'Suppose
a mountain lion should come, and a girl would
have to save herself from him, and would shoot,
though afraid&mdash;then she would be bold.' Oh,
how he laughed; and he said, 'You mean brave,
don't you?' And then he told me the difference."</p>

<p>"If you like Indians maybe you would be
pleased to hear some Indian songs," said Ramona.</p>

<p>"We would," replied Nellie. "There was a
little baby up at the Springs, and its father
used to put it to sleep in the afternoons by
swinging it in a hammock. He sang in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
queerest way. His song was pretty, too; but
whenever he saw that we were listening he
would stop."</p>

<p>"Come, then, to Concelio in the kitchen&mdash;she
will sing for you," said Alejandro.</p>

<p>They followed their young host, Nellie holding
fast to Ramona's hand. Concelio was shelling
peas.</p>

<p>"You must sing for these friends of ours,
Concelio," said Alejandro. "Shall I get your
guitar, Ramona? It sounds so much prettier
with the guitar."</p>

<p>"Maybe they will not like," said the old
woman, "my voice is so cracked."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we will," rejoined Walter. "We
love the Indians, and we like their songs." The
old woman murmured something in Spanish,
still smiling, however.</p>

<p>"What did she say?" whispered Nellie to
Ramona.</p>

<p>"She said you were strange white people if
you loved the Indians, but that she believed you
were speaking the truth and would sing for
you."</p>

<p>Alejandro returned with the guitar. Concelio
seated herself on the doorstep with the
group around her.</p>

<p>"This is putting the baby to sleep," said Concelio,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
beginning to sing in her own tongue, the
while she touched a few minor chords of the
guitar:</p>

<p>"That tune would put anybody to sleep,"
said Nellie; "but it is pretty."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>
<p>"Now one more, Concelio," said Ramona;
"that little hymn."</p>

<p>Changing the expression of her face at once
to one of the deepest devotion, the Indian woman
sang:</p>


<div class="center">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="i0">O Maria, O Maria,</div>

<p>There was something very pathetic and beautiful
in the refrain of this song. While Concelio
was singing the elders came to listen.
They would fain have heard more but, laughingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
shaking her head, Concelio ran away and
hid in her own room until they were gone.</p>

<p>The Se&#241;ora would not permit her visitors to
leave till next morning. When at last they tore
themselves away it was with the understanding
that Ramona and her brother should visit the
Pages for a couple of days before school began.</p>

<p>The friendship thus formed still continues,
and is shared with that of the Gordons, who
have returned to California.</p>

<p>Francisco, true to his promise, came in October
with a large load of wood, and several
sacks of walnuts which he had gathered for the
children.</p>

<p>He told them there had been another <i>Junta</i>,
the people still persisting that they did not wish
to leave their homes. "At last," he said, "the
white men grew angry, and said some Indians
must come with them and help choose, since
they knew best what they would like. 'Will you
come Captain Cecilio?' said one.</p>

<p>"'No, I will not,' said Cecilio. 'First I will
die.'</p>

<p>"'That is wrong,' said the man. 'You will
be sorry in the end, for you will have to go, and
you will give a bad example to your people.'</p>

<p>"'My people may do as they please,' said Cecilio.
'I give them no counsel. I tell them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
nothing. Whosoever wishes to go along with
you, he may; but not I.' And Captain Cecilio
walked away, oh, very, very sorrowful."</p>

<p>"And who went?" asked Mr. Page.</p>

<p>"My uncle, Mauricio, Ambrosio and Velasquez.
They did not want to go; but someone
must go. Soon they will choose, and it may
be that once more we shall be permitted to harvest
our crops at Cupa&mdash;but for the last time,

<p>And so it came to pass. Once again, and
only once, were the harvests gathered; once
more was heard the sound of the primitive flail
in the granaries of Cupa. Then its children
were bidden to make ready their goods and chattels,
their horses and cattle, their women folk,
their little ones and their dogs, weeping and
wailing as they went reluctantly forth from
their dismantled homes. Some among them
there were&mdash;these the very old&mdash;who escaped to
the mountains, and who were never heard of
again.</p>

<p>In the end no resistance was made. The Indians
obeyed the mandates of the stronger race
like the sullen but not insubordinate children
they are. And as wagon after wagon from the
deserted village reached the summit of the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
giving the last view of the vapory cloud rising
from the <i>Agua Caliente</i> of their fathers and
their fathers' fathers, each paused upon its onward
course, and the occupants looked back upon
the home they were leaving forever. Then,
folding their garments about them and bowing
their heads in voiceless sorrow, the children of
Cupa, lonely and broken-hearted, passed into
exile.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
